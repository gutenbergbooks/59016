<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Our Post Exchanges are usually in charge of officers with
little or no experience in book-keeping, their assistants are
usually enlisted men and not professional clerks and accountants,
and there is, at present, no codified or standard system
prescribed for handling this business. Some parts of the Post
Exchange Regulations have become antiquated through the
developments of modern business methods such as the
“Voucher Check System”.</p>

<p>In view of these facts it is felt that there is a real need of
this book, and it is hoped that the methods herein set forth
will prove to be a step toward a uniform system that will be
adopted in all Exchanges, one that will reduce overhead
charges, eliminate unnecessary labor and improve unsatisfactory
profits.</p>

<p>The writer intended discussing several other important
points, such as Journal Entries, Mail Order Business, Consignment,
Adding Machines, Loose-leaf and Card Index
Filing, etc., but circumstances over which he had no control
prevent, at present, any addition to these pages.</p>

<p>It is desired to give credit to Captain Henry M. Dichmann
24th Infantry, who by his work in connection with the
Post Exchange at Fort Slocum, N. Y., was the inspiration for
this work, and to Mr. James Parker, Cashier of the same Exchange,
for valuable assistance rendered.</p>

<h2 id="POST_EXCHANGE_METHODS">POST EXCHANGE METHODS.</h2>

<p>The general methods of conducting a Post Exchange are laid down
in official orders and considering the categorical nature of these orders
it would seem that the systems in all Exchanges should be almost identical.
Such, however, is far from the truth, as there are almost as many
systems as there are Exchanges, and a person in charge of one Exchange
might have to learn considerable new matter before he would be able
to administer the affairs of another Exchange. This variety of systems
also causes trouble to auditing officers, exchange councils and to inspectors
when they have occasion to go over the books. Some of the
systems are unsound in minor particulars, and most of them are poorly
designed. All trouble of this nature could be avoided by devising a standard
system and installing it in all Exchanges. The advantages of such
a proceeding would be manifold and there would be no important disadvantages.
In this essay an attempt has been made to evolve such a
system, one applicable to any Exchange, representing the best points of
many Exchanges and including at all possible points the labor saving
results of modern methods. The system here described is not the embodiment
of theory alone, but has been through the test of actual trial
and has given thorough satisfaction.</p>

<p>In devising any such scheme we must presuppose certain desiderata:—</p>

<p>1. The Exchange Officer can spend but a small portion of his time
in the Exchange, and yet he must have accurate knowledge of what the
business is doing. It is therefore essential that our records shall show
accurately and concisely all the data that are necessary to a full understanding
of the condition and operations of the business.</p>

<p>2. It is not enough to have a system which will enable us to render
a clear statement at the end of the month, we should be able to close our
books at any time and get out our financial statement in the minimum time.</p>

<p>3. Our system should be such as to minimize the possibilities of
peculation. It is often said that there is no system which cannot be beaten,
but there are systems which cannot be defeated for any great length of
time. Therefore, our system must reduce to a minimum the time during
which graft or theft can work undisturbed.</p>

<p>4. The system must be so simple that it will not require exceptional
ability at any point in order that its provisions may properly be carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
out. This makes it easy to break in new clerks, and enables them to perform
their duties in a more satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>5. The system must not be so cumbersome that it will delay the
making of sales. This is highly important. Every reader of this will
undoubtedly have vivid recollections of his experiences in department
stores, “waiting for change.” It is better to lose a dollar than to disgust
our customers and drive them elsewhere.</p>

<p>The above requirements cannot but cause our system to be somewhat
more expensive than that used in a “one-man store”. In the latter
instance, as a proprietor will not cheat himself, the third requirement has,
in general, no effect. The other requirements, however, will still hold,
and even gain in importance. How many merchants have we seen who
<em>thought</em> they knew all about their business, but who in reality knew very
little. They did not even realize that slipshod methods curtail credit and
beget losses of various sorts.</p>

<p>In describing this system we shall take up the various features in the
order in which they will be found easiest to install. For instance, charge
sales are discussed first because, regardless of the system of handling
these sales that may be in use by any Exchange, it will be found that to
change to the system here described, before changing any other part of
the system, will cause no confusion in the other books. In other words,
if your system be changed according to the order in which the different
parts are discussed herein, you will find that you have gradually installed
a system which may be entirely different, yet you have caused no confusion
in your books by the transition.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHARGE_SALES">CHARGE SALES.</h2>

<h3>General.</h3>

<p>This item includes the sale of merchandise to (1) officers, (2)
civilians, (3) enlisted men authorized to buy on credit. Such sales are
practically cash, being paid, usually, within a very short time.</p>

<p>The practice of extending credit to civilians is not encouraged by the
authorities and the Exchange Officer should secure permission beforehand
in case it is desired to transact this kind of business. In some cases of
isolated posts it is to the best interest of the government that civilians
employed or living on the post be allowed credit at the Exchange, as it
might otherwise be impossible for the Government to retain their services
or for the civilians to subsist themselves. It is to take care of such cases
that this feature is mentioned. In opening a charge account with a
civilian, care must be exercised to prevent a probability of loss to the
Exchange, as one bad account might wipe out the profits from all such
accounts for a considerable time. If a civilian is deserving of the privilege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of purchasing at the Exchange he should have no objection to conferring
with the Post Exchange Officer and making satisfactory arrangements
with his employer.</p>

<p>With enlisted men, the case is more difficult. In general, the soldier
makes his credit purchases by means of coupons. But if the Exchange handles
some such proposition as an ice delivery route, it is impossible to do
business with the patrons thereof by means of coupons of the ordinary
kind. The right method is to apply to the proper authorities for permission
to extend to married soldiers credit to such amounts as may be recommended
by their organization commanders. If this is not done, and credit
other than in the shape of coupons is allowed enlisted men or if coupons
or credit in excess of one-third of the man’s pay be allowed him, the
inspector will object to it, as either of these two proceedings is held to be
unauthorized. However, when there are no other stores in the vicinity,
it seems but reasonable to think that the Post Exchange, instituted purely
for the benefit of the enlisted man, should be allowed to extend credit to
such married soldiers of good reputation as may be dependent upon it
(and the Commissary) for the necessities of life. As the married soldier
is usually a non-commissioned officer of long and honorable service (sometimes
a first sergeant or non-commissioned staff officer) with one or more
children; as the bulk of his pay is usually spent for articles ordinarily
carried in stock by the Exchange; as the Exchange is the result of beneficent
legislation and the regulations concerning same should therefore be
interpreted in a liberal manner, it follows that there is a great deal of
justice behind a proper application for permission to make charge sales
to such selected men.</p>

<p>In case such permission is obtained, request should be made on the
various organization commanders to write a letter of the following purport:—</p>

<h3>Method of Making Charge Sales.</h3>

<p>At the time each charge sale is made, the clerk notes the transaction
on a “Charge Sales Slip,” provided for the purpose, noting the date, name
of customer, name and number of articles sold, the total price of each
item, the total amount covered by the slip and the initials of the salesmen.
See Fig. 1.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>It has become almost a rule that the purchaser shall receive a copy of
this record of sale. Sometimes, he does not receive it until after he has
paid his bill at the end of the month, a procedure followed in many clubs
and similar organizations. It is probably better in Post Exchange work
to furnish the purchaser with a copy of the charge sales slip at the time
the purchase is made, as most of our customers wish to keep track of their
accounts and also, as will be shown later, this method may be made to promote
honesty in salesmen who might be tempted to be otherwise. As it
is, of course, essential that we retain at least one copy of this sales slip, it
follows that the use of some sort of manifolding device is necessary.
There are many such devices on the market, among which may be mentioned
as representative, the manifolding sales book and the autographic
register. The former is shown in Fig. 2 and the latter in Fig. 3, from
which their methods of operation are apparent.</p>

<p>It is patent that some
such scheme should be
adopted for use in every
Exchange, no matter
how small that Exchange
may be. The advantages
of any of these systems
(even a simple duplicating
pad) over the painful
and inefficient method of
recording all such sales in an old
fashioned sales record book must
be evident to every one. The particular
system adopted is of minor
importance so long as it is thoroughly
adapted to the circumstances
of the case involved. The
following table is arranged for the
purpose of permitting a comparison
of two systems; one involving
the use of manifolding sales
books and the other using an autographic
register.</p>

two sales slips it is evident that we record our sale on the first and second slips and
also secure a reversed copy on the back of the original. It is said that salesmen
who alter such slips for their own gain are prone to forget or overlook this point
and are caught thereby. No alteration on a sales slip should be tolerated; if the
clerk makes a mistake he should be required to cancel and preserve all copies of the
erroneous slip and to make out a new one correctly.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is seen that the advantages and disadvantages of these two systems
nearly counterbalance and that the particular system adopted must depend
greatly upon the opinions of those in charge of the Exchange. In the following
description, the use of triplicating records will be assumed.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate the assorting of the slips handed in by the various
“Departments” of the Exchange, it is a good idea to assign distinctive
colors to the original charge sales slips of each. (Of course, if there is a very
large number of departments, this idea would have to be applied with
discretion, as it is hard to recognize certain colors at night by artificial
light.) For example, let the original sales slips used in the store be white;
those in the market, buff; those in the shoe shop, pink, etc. The duplicate
slips should have their own distinctive color and this color should be the
same for all departments. If a triplicate slip is used, it should be of still
another color and the same for all departments. Following out this
scheme, the utility of which will appear presently, a color scheme might
be as follows:—</p>

</table>

<p>If a system of distinctive colors similar to the above is not adopted,
one of two things will be necessary in order that we may identify the slips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of each department, unless we wish to do so by wasting the time in
deciphering the articles on each slip and decide therefrom the name of the
responsible department; we must either have the names of the departments
printed on their respective slips when they are made, or these names must
be marked on the slips when the sales are made. Neither of these methods
is as efficient as that involving the use of various colors, which tells automatically
to what department that slip belongs. By using distinctive colors,
the printer would set up only one form for printing our whole assortment,
and our printing bill would be correspondingly reduced.</p>

<p>In this connection, it might be stated for the benefit of the uninitiated
that ordinarily the principal items in our bills for printing, especially in
the case of blank forms, will be found to consist of the cost of “composition”,
“make-up”, “lock-up”, and “make-ready”. These operations are
necessary if but one form is printed; they need cost us no more if 50,000
copies are printed. Paper is comparatively cheap, so it usually costs us
little more to print 5,000 copies than to print 1,000. So we can see that
in the case of blank forms the cost per unit varies inversely as the quantity
ordered at one time. Hence, if we need such forms as sales slips, of
which we may use hundreds per day, we should order, say, a year’s supply
at a time. Other forms or sheets that are used once a week or once a
month must be ordered in lots sufficient to last for a longer time. As we
take these up on our Stock Record, such purchases in large quantities will
not disturb the worth of the Exchange.</p>

<p>An appreciable amount in the cost of our printing can be saved by a
skillful arrangement of the matter on the form. An experienced man can
sometimes draft a form so that the charges for printing it will be half
what it would cost to print the same form arranged by a thoughtless or
inexperienced person. Tabular work costs money, and so also does
“special rulings”. Experience or consultation with a practical printer is
the only real guide in this matter.</p>

<p>If any form is used in large numbers, it will pay to have electrotypes
made, and “repeat orders” printed therefrom. Forms that are seldom used
should not be electrotyped, as they will probably require some alteration
by the time a new supply is needed. An electrotype costs about $0.25 for
the first square inch and about $0.04 for each additional square inch. Here
is another opportunity for the exercise of judgment. Suppose we have a
large form with printed heading and footing, but nothing in the middle of
the sheet; it would be wasteful to electrotype the whole form, only the
heading and the footing should be so treated. Now, let us consider the
money wasted by having the name of our post printed on each bit of
stationery! It is easy to see that this is in some cases a positive disadvantage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Suppose, for example, that Form 8, Fig. 1, fills the requirements
of Exchange methods. If a dozen Exchanges order a supply of these
forms and (as they usually do) thoughtlessly require that the names of
their respective posts be printed on same, they each pay a great deal more
than they would if they allowed the printer to make an electrotype of this
form and run off all the jobs from the same plate. It is hard, if not
impossible, to find any real reason why this extra matter should be placed
on many of our forms. Coöperation in matters of this kind would go far
toward cutting down some of our “overhead charges” in Post Exchange
work, and to secure such coöperation is one of the objects of this paper.</p>

<p>Still another way to minimize our printing bill is to adopt standard
sizes for our forms and to use, wherever possible, the same kind and color
of paper. Paper comes in sheets of certain sizes and if the printer has to
waste a part of each sheet in printing our forms, we shall have to pay for
it. Uniformity in size also leads to facility of filing. Incidentally, money
may be saved, in some cases by having two or more forms printed together.
For example, suppose we have three forms, A, B and C, to be printed on
the same stock, and we wish 5,000 A; 10,000 B; and 15,000 C. If ordered
separately, these would entail 30,000 impressions. Suppose, however, that
they are ordered at the same time, and that the forms are of such sizes
(not necessarily equal) that they may be printed together on one sheet
and cut apart afterwards. In such a case, a saving might be made as
follows:—Set up each form once, make, one electrotype of Form B and
two of Form C; place these with the originals and there will result, in one
“form” three Forms C, two Forms B, and one Form A, and a “run” of
5,000 impressions will print the lot ordered. There is a saving of the cost
of running 5,000 Form B and 10,000 Form C less the cost of electrotypes
(if they are not on hand) and of the extra work of locking up and making
ready same. Of course, such a procedure assumes that a considerable
supply of forms, say, not less than a total of 5,000, is ordered at one time.
For a fewer number, there would be no saving unless electrotypes were
already on hand.</p>

<p>To return, now, to our sales slips. It will be noted that our triplicate
copies are the same for all departments. They are kept in rolls, if manifolding
machines are used, or if triplicating sales books are used, the tissue
paper sheets that are left in the books form our retained record. In the
cases of both the triplicate and the duplicate copies, a cheap grade of paper
is allowable on account of the little handling these copies have to withstand.
Also, there is no reason for their being susceptible of rapid assorting according
to departments. The duplicates are also identical for all departments,
they go to the customer at the time of sale. In case there is a
discussion about any particular slip, the items thereon will show conclusively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to what department it belongs, as will also the initials of the salesman.
On the other hand, it is a positive advantage to have all duplicates of a
distinctive color, different from that of the originals. Suppose a customer
buys a pair of shoes from the store and later returns them. We should
then give him a slip crediting him with the shoes at the selling price. To
do this, all that is necessary is to fill out a regular charge sales slip in the
usual manner except that the word CREDIT is plainly marked on the slip.
The clerk then gives the customer the <em>original</em> of this credit voucher and
files the newspaper <em>duplicate</em> in the usual way. Upon sorting the slips that
night, the duplicate would be noticed, on account of its difference from
the other slips handed in and would thus prevent mistakes. Likewise, if
it became necessary for, say, the lunch room to buy a ham from the market,
the market attendant could make out his charge sales slip as usual, giving
the duplicate to the lunch room attendant with the ham. That night, the
appearance of this grayish duplicate among the salmon originals handed in
by the lunch room attendant would immediately call attention to the transaction.
It might be stated here, at the risk of lapsing into the axiomatic,
that such a transaction, although favored by some exchanges, is not good
business. It should be of rare occurrence and even then needs special
treatment. The proper procedure in such cases would be to have the
Market turn the ham back to the Stock Room, receive credit for it and
then let the Lunch Room draw the ham at the cost price. This point is
more fully discussed in connection with Stock Records.</p>

<p>After the attendant has recorded the charge sale in the proper manner
and given the duplicate slip to the purchaser, he still has to dispose of
another copy (or two other copies if triplicating records are used). The
original should be speared onto an ordinary file, each clerk having his own
filing hook in a convenient but inconspicuous place. The triplicate is left
in the sales book or on the roll, as the case may be. In addition, the clerk
should be required to ring up the sale on the cash register. This is, of
course, very important, and heroic measures should be adopted to insure
the recording of every sale, of whatever kind, on the cash register. Means
to this end can readily be devised. The subject of cash registers is a very
important one and is discussed in detail elsewhere.</p>

<p>The above operations are described at some length, but in reality, they
are simple in the extreme: a customer makes a purchase, the clerk records
the sale, rings up the amount on the cash register, gives the customer his
goods and a copy of the sales slip and sticks the other copy on his file. If
the cash register prints tickets, he may drop the ticket in his compartment
of a box or drawer provided for the purpose, or preferably, give it to the
customer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<h3>Daily Check of Charge Sales</h3>

<p>After the day’s business is over, each clerk gathers up all his receipts
for the day and assorts them into three piles, representing the cash, coupon
and charge sales, respectively. He then makes out his sales report on
Form 5 as shown in Fig. 4. This report should be printed on the face of
an end-opening envelope measuring not more than 4¼ × 10 inches, thus
forming a convenient receptacle for the coupons, charge slips and cash
turned in. The printed form should be, say, 7½ × 3 inches. As these
envelopes are not subjected to rough usage, being used but once, any kind
of cheap paper will serve the purpose. It might be well in certain cases
to have the envelopes match the color of the original charge sales slips for
that department, but ordinarily, this would be found an unnecessary refinement.
After making out this sales report, the clerk places in the
envelope the cash, coupons, etc., and hands it to the Post Exchange Officer
or to the Steward, if so authorized. (For obvious reasons, the Exchange
Officer personally should receive and check the receipts the night of pay-day
and at intervals during the month, even if the Steward is ordinarily authorized
to do so.) The Steward or Cashier has meanwhile unlocked the
cash register, noted the readings of the record wheels and taken out the
tape showing the printed record of sales.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/figure4.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 4. (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p>Now, assuming that triplicate records are used, the Steward takes the
triplicate copies—either book or roll—“throws” them or checks them for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
numbering, to see that all are accounted for, and totals their value on the
adding machine. By comparing this total with that shown by the appropriate
wheels of the cash register, he ascertains if all charge sales have
been rung up. If these two agree, all is well, so far. If they do not agree,
a note is made of the discrepancy for use in connection with the operations
hereafter described.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/figure5.jpg" width="500" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 5, (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p>By this time, the clerks should be ready to hand in their reports and
receipts. The Steward fills out the rest of Form 5 as called for by the
various columns and abstracts these reports to his Form 4 as shown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Fig. 5. This form should be printed on a card measuring 3½ × 8⅜ inches,
to permit convenient filing. If printed on thin paper, it will have to be
filed on a Shannon file which is not so convenient in the long run. These
cards should be of fairly good stock, as they are a part of the permanent
records of the Exchange, but should be no heavier than necessary. The
Steward carries down the totals on Form 4 and compares them with the
three separate totals shown by the cash register. Restricting ourselves to a
discussion of the charge sales, we see that if the total of the triplicate slips,
the totals of the clerks’ reports and the total shown by the cash register all
agree then the charge sales statement shown on Form 4 is correct. If
there is any discrepancy in this or any other column of Form 4 the mistake
should be found and corrected before the clerks are dismissed for the
night. Suppose, for example, that the cash register shows a total of $20.60
charge sales for the day and the total on Form 4 is $21.90. The first step
is to have the clerks make sure that their reports correctly state the actual
amount of charge sales slips turned in. If they are correct, then some
clerk has probably forgotten to ring up one or more sales. To trace the
fault, let the Steward read off all the charge sales from the record tape of
the cash register, calling off at the same time the letter of the clerk who
rang up each sale. These can be compared with the triplicate copy of the sales
slips, or the assembled clerks can be required to note the sales accredited
to them, the grand total of which <em>must</em> equal $20.60. In this manner, the
error is definitely located. On the other hand, suppose the cash register
shows $21.90 and the total on Form 4 shows $20.60. The effect is that
produced by a clerk being short $1.30 in charge sales slips after he has
actually made the sales. The same procedure as before will locate the
mistake. If he cannot produce the slips (or cash or coupons as the case
may be) or satisfactorily explain the mistake, the clerk in error should be
required to make good the discrepancy. Discrepancies in cash and coupons
can be located and remedied in the same manner. It is important that the
clerks be required to participate in the task of locating mistakes and to
make good on errors, otherwise there will be no incentive to careful work.</p>

<p>When the totals of the clerks’ reports check against the cash registers,
the next step is to check the former against the receipts in cash, coupons
and charge sales slips actually turned in by the respective clerks. The cash
should, in fact, be counted immediately upon being turned in, checked O. K.
on the clerks’ reports and put in a safe place. The charge slips handed in
by each clerk are compared with the strip from the adding machine (on
which the clerk has added up his slips before making out his report)
checked against the report and put aside for filing. Coupons are handled
in the same way except that they are sealed in the envelope and put in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
secure place until the Exchange Officer personally can burn them. This
matter of destroying coupons should never be delegated to any other
person. In view of the fact that the receipts turned in by each clerk
should, and usually do, check exactly with his report, this particular routine
is recommended, as it allows the dismissal of the clerks before commencing
the work described in this paragraph. In case of mistakes, the simple
expedient of making the clerk at fault assist in the work for a few evenings,
is usually sufficient to prevent a repetition. In large Exchanges, where
the coupon and charge sales are large, it is not customary to total the
charge sales slips and count the coupons until the next morning. If the
receipts turn out to be greater than called for by the reports, the surplus
can be taken up by entering on a single line of Form 26 (described hereafter),
whenever the books are closed (or oftener, if desired) an item showing
what departments are credited with these excess coupons, exactly as if it
were another day’s transactions. Such entry should, however, be prefaced
by the words, “excess coupons”. Shortages should be collected from the
clerk at fault, thus making the reports correct. The Exchange Officer
should occasionally make the coupon and the charge sales counts himself.</p>

<p>It would be unbusinesslike, if the coupon or charge sales are heavy, to
require the Exchange Officer, the Steward or any other high priced man
to waste his time counting coupons or any other similar task. A less expensive
employee should be detailed for this purpose. For such unskilled
labor, a boy at $10.00 per month who can run errands, etc., would be a
profitable investment in many cases, thus leaving the expensive employees
free to do more important work.</p>

<p>Too much stress cannot be placed upon the importance of insuring the
correctness of the data entered on Form 4. If the above mentioned checks
have been applied, there should be no trouble in any phase of our charge
accounts.</p>

<h3>Daily Summary of Charge Sales.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/figure6.jpg" width="700" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 6. (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p>For various self-evident reasons, we use Form 7, shown in Fig. 6, for
showing a month’s charge sales. This form gives us in a most convenient
shape, a summary of that part of our (daily) Forms 4 that relates to our
charge sales business, it safeguards us against the loss of any Form 4 and
facilitates posting our ledger accounts. This form is kept up to date, the
charge sales from Form 4 being entered thereon daily, and therefore, affords
us a most efficient aid in closing our books at any moment. At the
end of the month, or whenever the books are closed, we find the totals of
the columns of Form 7 and post these totals as lump sums into the ledger.
For example, the total of column 1 is posted as a debit in the ledger against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Bills Receivable, Customers; the total of column 2 as a credit to the same
account. The total of column 3 should be posted as a debit against the
Store account in the ledger, this being for articles returned to the store by
our customers; the total of column 4 is posted as a credit to the store
account, being for articles sold from same, etc. These sheets, constituting
Form 7 are 11 × 14 inches, and cost $1.75 per hundred without printed
headings; a sectional post binder to fit them can be bought for $3.75. The
sheet is the same on both sides and will, therefore, take care of seven
departments if we use the whole width of the open book. This will be
found ample in most cases. It is useless expense to have the headings, etc.,
printed on the sheets, because a single sheet with neatly written headings
can be made to serve as a sort of index for a great many sheets, provided
they are mounted above it and are trimmed off just below the headings
“DR.” “CR.”, and also trimmed on the outside margin so that the date
figures on the lowermost sheet will serve as an index to the lines of the
upper sheets. This labor and money saving point will be more fully discussed
later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h3>Recording Charge Sales Slips.</h3>

<p>After these slips have been checked against the clerks’ reports, they
must be sorted out and filed according to the names of the purchasers.
For this work, have two card index drawers, each fitted with a set of
guide cards marked on the tabs with the names of our charge customers.
As each slip is found, file it behind the proper name. We first take all
the “Store” slips and file them in this manner; we then go through this
“sorting drawer” and total the slips belonging to each customer and enter
these totals in the column representing that date on Form 9, (see Fig. 7)
opposite the names of the respective customers. At the same time, we
insert the sales slips diagonally in their proper places in the other or
permanent filing drawer. The total of these entries on Form 9 should
equal the total charge sales credited that date to the Store on Form 7.
If it does, the slips that have been placed diagonally can be shoved down
into the proper places as we are through with them; if it does not, they
can easily be removed for further examination. This daily check should
invariably be made for each department. We proceed in like manner with
respect to the other departments, each department having its own sheet or
sheets like Form 9. It is evident that this form gives us a summary of all
the charge sales made each day from each department, showing the
amounts sold to each of our customers. At the end of the month, each line
is added across and the total entered. The “Total” column is then added
up and compared with the total obtained by adding together the figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
(representing the daily totals) on the bottom line. If these two totals
check against each other and against the total shown on Form 7, the
account may be considered correct and is a record of the daily transactions
between our customers and the department considered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/figure7.jpg" width="700" height="425" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 7. (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p>The book in which we bind our Form 9 is known as the “Charge
Book”, and it may be well to explain here the physical make-up of this
important book of record. It is, of course, on the loose-leaf principle,
being of the type known as a “sectional post binder”. It costs $2.50 and the
ruled sheets (without special printing) cost $1.00 per hundred. It is,
however, to the manner of handling the sheets of the book that attention
is especially invited. The old fashioned way would be to enter the names
of our customers down the left hand margin of each sheet until all were
entered, put the name of the department and the month and year at the
top of the sheet and the days of the month at the tops of the successive
columns with the heading “Total” at the right of the sheet. Thus, if we
had five departments and enough credit customers to require six sheets
for the list, we should have to prepare thirty sheets in this manner every
month. Now, to show how we can eliminate unnecessary work by the
exercise of a little forethought, let us assume that we have started our
record in this manner. Now take six copies of Form 9, trim them along
the heavy broken lines shown in Fig. 7, and bind one of these sheets in
front of each of those we have previously prepared. It is obvious that
the book is now ready for another month’s entries without any preparatory
writing or numbering whatever other than labelling each new sheet in
some convenient place with the month and department to which it pertains.
Of course, to care for the five departments, we should have to do this for
all five sets of sheets that we originally prepared. It follows that, provided
our list of customers does not change, this same operation of inserting
trimmed sheets would constitute the only labor necessary to continue
this record for an indefinite period.</p>

<p>After considerable experimenting and actual trial in service, the following
described scheme has been evolved for handling this record in an
efficient manner. While no claim is made that it is perfect, it is believed
that it will give thorough satisfaction wherever it is given a fair trial and
will save many hours of labor in keeping the books.</p>

<p>1. Take a sheet, Form 9, and enter the names of your charge customers
in alphabetical order, commencing on a left hand page. To allow
for future changes, leave a blank line before each name and one or two
blank lines at the bottom of the page for sub-totals, etc. For clearness
and permanence, these names should be put in from a black “record” typewriter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
ribbon. Write in the headings of the various columns as shown on
Form 9. The object in placing the “total” column near the outside margin
is to have it next the customer’s name, thus minimizing the chances of
error in taking out the wrong total when we make our postings at the end
of the month.</p>

<p>2. If our list of charge customers will require more than one sheet,
take another Form 9 which we shall call Sheet No. 2 and proceed in a
like manner, using the same side of the sheet as before. This should be
repeated until all our charge customers are entered. Several blank lines
are left at the bottom of the last sheet. Thus, when we have finished and
have inserted the sheets in our book, we shall have a complete list of our
charge customers all recorded on the left hand pages of our book, that
side of each sheet that forms the right hand pages of our book being blank.</p>

<p>3. Now, in order to utilize these blank pages, thus avoiding unnecessary
waste, we proceed as follows:—Open your book between <em>Sheets</em> 1 and
2; <em>page</em> 1 will then be on the left and <em>page</em> 2 on the right. This page 2
should now be prepared in a manner exactly similar to that used in preparing
page 1, except that the customers’ names are on the right hand
margin with the total column next inside. This is clearly shown in Fig. 7.</p>

<p>4. Prepare the blank sides of the other sheets in a similar manner
and we shall then have two complete lists of our charge customers, one
occupying the left and the other the right hand pages of our book, the
confronting pages being practically symmetrical.</p>

<p>5. Let us assume that the Exchange has five separate departments in
which charge sales can occur. We cut five sheets along the heavy broken
lines shown in Fig. 7 and insert them between pages 1 and 2. Five more
trimmed sheets are inserted between sheets (whole sheets) 2 and 3, and
so on for the rest of the book. In order to identify these sheets if accidentally
removed from the binder and to facilitate the making of entries,
we print on each of them in large letters, the name of the department and
the month to which they refer. This is best done lightly with red ink as
shown (in black) in Fig. 7 where the sheet is marked STORE—AUG.
This red ink lettering will not obscure the black ink figures subsequently
made.</p>

<p>6. Let us agree to use the left hand pages for the first month’s account
and the right hand pages for the next month’s account. Let us take the
first trimmed sheet and mark it “STORE—JAN” on one side, and
“STORE—FEB” on the other. Do similarly for the sheets reserved for
the “market”, “lunch room”, and other accounts. The sheets containing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
typewritten headings are not used for recording sales, but are used for
guide sheets, for reasons to be set forth later.</p>

<p>It is easy to see from the preceding description that our charge book
is a running account, and being always up to date, can be closed at short
notice. When two months’ records have been entered, the trimmed sheets
are lifted and filed, as will be described hereafter. Fresh trimmed sheets
are again inserted in the proper places and the record proceeds as before.</p>

<h3>Consolidating Charge Sales Monthly.</h3>

<p>The form in which we have placed our daily records of credit sales
lends itself very readily to a process of summation or consolidation. The
manner of doing this is as follows:—</p>

<p>1. Prepare a second double list of our credit customers exactly as
described above, except that the columns, instead of being headed with the
days of the month, are labelled with the names of the various departments,
as shown in Fig. 8. Let us call this Form 6. Blank sheets trimmed along
the heavy broken lines, shown in Fig. 7, are inserted as before, no recording
being done on the typewritten sheets—they are simply guides or indices
to the various lines and columns.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/figure8.jpg" width="700" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 8. (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p>2. All these sheets are bound in a separate book to facilitate the work
of posting at the end of the month. Experiment seems to prove that this
is better than binding these records in the same book with the charge
sheets just described. This, for the reason that a clerk is apt to waste too
much time in continually turning pages back and forth and is also more
liable to make errors in posting.</p>

<p>3. Immediately after the end of the month, Form 7, is checked against
Form 9 as previously described. We then take, say, the “store” charge
sheets (Form 7) and enter on Form 6 the total that each customer owes
the store. We do the same for every other department, also entering the
balance remaining unpaid from last month in the column provided for the
purpose. We also record in the proper column any credit we have given
our customers during the month for goods returned, overcharges, etc.</p>

<p>4. By using the adding machine, we find the total of each department’s
column on Form 6; it should equal the total charge sales for that
department reported on Forms 7 and 9. If it does not, the error must be
found and corrected before proceeding further. These totals, when correct,
are entered at the foot of their proper columns on the last sheet of
the record. Now add these column-totals on the machine and enter the
result in pencil at the foot of the “Total” column on the same last sheet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of this Form 6 record; it should check against the grand total of the charge
sales for the month reported on Forms 7 and 9.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/figure9.jpg" width="440" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 9. Actual size</p>
</div>

<p>5. When all postings to our Form 6 are complete, we station one
clerk at the adding machine and one is prepared to make out our monthly
bills or statements of account, using Form 1, shown in Fig. 9. Some person
reads off Form 6 the name of each customer and the total charges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
against him by each department. These items are added on the machine
and simultaneously entered by the bill clerk on Form 1. The adding machine
operator reads the total of the items he has added, which total is
entered by the bill clerk on his Form 1 and by us in the column headed,
“Total” on our Form 6.</p>

<p>6. Any credit due the customer is read off to and entered by the bill
clerk on the statement. He then figures the balance due the Post Exchange,
which balance should agree with that figured independently by the person
reading from Form 6.</p>

<p>7. When the last bill has been made out, take the printed strip from
the adding machine and find the sum of all the totals that have been read
off by the operator. This sum should equal the pencil total described in
Par. 4 above and checks the correctness of the account. If a “Duplex”
adding machine is used, this does not require extra work. If the accounts
do not “jibe” and the error cannot be found, take in rotation the charge
slips that you have filed against each customer and add them on the machine,
making a separate total for each customer. This should locate the
error. If the accounts check, however, (and they should if the previous
checks have been made properly) this laborious operation is unnecessary.</p>

<p>All our bills are now ready for mailing, and they are made out correctly.
In order to obtain the full benefit of this method, our bill forms
should require the minimum amount of writing. The form shown in Fig.
9 gives satisfaction. It is a 3 × 5 inch card and therefore fits standard size
card index drawers; it is easily handled and will go into a note size penalty
envelope without folding. The appropriate month can be stamped in and
the name of the customer entered during spare moments throughout the
month, so that the only work necessary at this time is to write in the
figures. If the lines of Form 1 are “typewriter spaced”, that is, six to the
inch, and the form is not too heavy, it can be placed directly in the adding
machine and the various amounts printed on the card. The names of the
various departments should be printed on this card in the same order in
which they occur on Form 6. In fact, much work will be saved if some
specific scheme of sequence or relative order among the different departments
is invariably followed.</p>

<p>The writer does not know of a more economical or efficient system
of handling the bug-a-boo of “getting out our monthly bills” than that
just described. Sometimes, a “duplicating bill-book” is used, but it is a
wasteful and inefficient method when compared to this. One of the principal
advantages of the system lies in the fact that it is unnecessary to keep
a private ledger account for any of our charge customers. If we were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
do so, we should simply repeat information that we already have. It will
be remembered that we have filed away our triplicate record of each day’s
charge sales, which record describes in detail the particulars of every sale
made on that day. From this, should the necessity arise, we can reconstruct
our whole charge sales record for the month. We have also on file
(until the bill is paid) another copy of each charge sales slip, filed according
to the names of customers, which, in itself, constitutes one side of the
ledger account that would be kept under the old system. These, together
with the records previously described, amply warrant the abolition of
customers’ private ledger accounts. Another great advantage of this
system lies in the ease and rapidity with which the books can be closed at
any time.</p>

<p>Attention is invited to the note at the bottom of Form 1. This is a
labor saving item that is in accord with the practice of many up-to-date
houses—to regard a canceled and endorsed check as the best form of receipt.
Hence, if a customer pays his bill by check, it is unnecessary to
receipt the bill and return it to him, our endorsement on his check constitutes
his receipt. This same procedure can be made to apply to companies, etc.;
also, if the company commander will use the sales slips as his
sub-vouchers for the expenditure.</p>

<h3>Credit Transactions.</h3>

<p>We shall now take up the procedure to be followed in recording any
and all credit which we allow to customers for overcharges, goods returned,
etc. It is apparent that such transaction must occur in any business.
Accurate track should be kept of them and they should be handled
in the most efficient and time-saving manner possible. Each such transaction
results in a credit against our Bills Receivable and a charge or debit
against the particular department involved.</p>

<p>As before stated, the clerk who receives the goods that are returned to
us makes out a charge sales slip, marks it “CREDIT” and keeps the duplicate,
giving the original to the customer. It is usually the rule that nobody
other than the Steward or the Exchange Officer himself has authority to
give customers credit in this way. In the evening, the clerk hands in these
credit slips with his report. When the Steward makes up his report on
Form 4, after verifying the clerks’ reports, he simply enters these credits
in the last column on his Form 4, totals them and describes each separate
credit transaction on the back of his report. All the data relating to the
charge sales (and credits given) during the day that are shown on the face
of Form 4 are abstracted to the appropriate line of Form 7, which latter
sheet gives us in concise form all the data we need concerning our charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sales for the month. The credit slips are gathered up and placed with the
filed charge sales slips relating to the person who returned the goods to us.
At the end of the month, preparatory to making out our bills, all credits
are entered in the column headed “Credit” on Form 6, and are checked
against the totals shown on Form 7. This avoids the necessity of entering
each credit transaction on a separate line of Form 7 as such transaction
occurs. Even if the credit slip were lost, no error should result, because
we check the total credits entered on Form 6 against the total credits on
Form 7 before we start making out our bills. If these do not agree, we
must check both Forms 6 and 7 against the credits shown daily by the
various Forms 4. We also have another check in the triplicate copy of the
credit slips that has been filed away.</p>

<p>Below is a graphic chart which shows how to handle this system of
charge accounts. It shows how the various records experience a continuous
process of summation until they finally reach the ledger and the customer’s
bill, and how the accounts can be checked as we go along, thus
avoiding errors. Solid lines show posting operations, broken lines show
possible checking operations.</p>

<h3>Settling Charge Accounts.</h3>

<p>When any of our charge customers pays his bill, we make an entry in
our cash book, giving to each such payment a separate line. We enter the
amount of the payment in the column headed “Net Cash” and also in the
column headed “Customers”. We do <em>not</em> enter any of this amount in the
columns referring to the various departments because they have already
been credited for their proper shares through the charge sales records and
to do so again in the cash book would manifestly give them double credit
for each charge sale. We also stamp “Paid” in the “Cash” column of
Form 6, using a dating stamp that will fit neatly into this column. One
using red ink is preferable. If only a part of the bill is paid, we enter in
this column the amount received, extend the balance to the proper column
and, at the proper time, carry it forward to next month’s account. Some
book-keepers of the old school will keep a “blotter” or some such book
wherein these payments are first noted, copying them at their leisure into
the Cash Book. As the Cash Book is a book of original record, this is not
only wrong, but is incidentally unnecessary labor and hence to be avoided.
When payments like these come in, they should be taken directly to the
book-keeper, who should immediately enter them in the Cash Book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/figure10.jpg" width="700" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 10.</p>
</div>

<p>All such payments occurring on any one day are entered in a lump
sum under “Collections,” on the Form 4 for that day. In fact, all cash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
received, whether from paymasters’ collections on payrolls or any source
other than cash sales by any of our departments, is taken up on Form 4 as
“Collections”. If a bill is paid before the end of the month, it is treated
exactly the same as if it were paid afterward, except that the date is
stamped in a different colored ink. It does not confuse our accounts,
because the amount paid is entered in the “Customers’” column of the
Cash Book and the total of this column is posted at the end of the month to
the credit side of Bills Receivable, Customers, in the ledger. The “Customers’”
column in the Cash Book is solely for receipts from our charge
customers and for nothing else.</p>

<p>If, at any time, we wish to find the total charge sales, we simply find
the total of the amounts shown on Form 7, subtracting credits, if any. We
also use the total sales credited to the various departments on Form 7 in
making up our monthly statement for the auditing officer and for the Inspector.
To find out at the end of the month the amount due us on account,
we turn to Bills Receivable, Customers, in the ledger, where the
balance should show the correct amount. This amount should check with
the “Total” column on Form 6 reduced by credits allowed and payments
received prior to the end of the month.</p>

<h3>Dead and Live Records.</h3>

<p>It will be remembered that all our Forms 9 were placed in one book
and our Forms 6 in another, and that each Form 9 was to be used for
two months, that is, used on both sides. After both sides have been used
these forms are transferred bodily to the book containing our Forms 6, and
placed between the Forms 6 referring to these months. Fresh Forms 9
take the place of those transferred, thus keeping our book “alive” and
placing our dead records where they will be less in the way. The logic of
this is evident when we remember that we use our Charge Book (Form 6)
only at the end of the month, whereas, we use our Form 9 book every day.</p>

<p>As regards Form 8 (charge sales slip) our rolls of triplicate sales
slips for the month should be marked on the outside of each roll with the
date and the name of the department to which each pertains and kept in a
convenient place until the auditing officer has finished his work for that
month, when they should be stored together in some place where they can
be consulted if desired. They should be preserved for such length of time
as may be required by regulations or local laws, depending upon which is
the greater. The original slips may be treated in one of two ways; they
may be sent to the customer with his bill at the end of the month, or they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
may be sent to him after he pays his bill. It is felt that the first method is
by far the better.</p>

<p>Forms 5 for the month should be preserved until the auditor has finished
with them, and it is perhaps advisable to keep them until after the
next visit of the inspector. Our Forms 4 are very important and should be
kept until after the inspector has inspected the accounts of the Exchange, if
not indefinitely. Forms 6, 7 and 9 are a part of the permanent records of
the Exchange and should be preserved indefinitely.</p>

<p>The foregoing description of this system of handling charge accounts
may sound formidable to the layman, but in reality, it is not so. As shown
in the graphic chart (Fig. 10) it is a logical system, proceeding in a simple,
orderly way from the charge sales slip to the ledger and the customer’s
bill. It belongs to the class of book-keeping called “controlled accounts”—each
part of the system knits evenly into the others, and there is a continual
process of summation going on throughout the records. There is no
duplicated work and every step is one of definite progress towards the goal.
It will be found to fulfil the requirements we imposed at the beginning of
this essay. It has actually proved its worth wherever installed. It is
equally adapted to the large and to the small Exchange. Due to the many
available opportunities for checking the correctness of results, mistakes are
easily located and corrected. However, if the checks described are applied,
especially those relating to Form 4, there should be little excuse for a mistake
to appear in any of the higher accounts.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CASH_SALES">CASH SALES.</h2>

<p>In the light of the preceding discussion of charge sales, our methods
of handling cash sales can be disposed of in a few words. In all cases of
such sales, the clerk simply gives the customer his goods, receiving the
money therefor, makes change if necessary, rings up the amount of the sale
on the cash register and places the cash therein. The most important part
of this transaction, insofar as our system is concerned, is described in the
next-to-last clause. If the salesman once rings up the correct amount on
the cash register, the store is sure that the transaction is closed, and closed
properly. Means to this end will be discussed under the heading of “Cash
Registers”.</p>

<p>It is customary to loan, secured by various kinds of receipts, a suitable
sum to the heads of the various departments of the Exchange for the purpose
of making change. In some cases, it may be advisable to require them
to make a cash deposit to cover these amounts. When the Cashier or
Steward is under bond, it is feasible to turn the “change money” of the
whole Exchange over to him, taking his note for it.</p>

<p>After closing at night, each clerk enters his cash sales on his sales
report (Form 5, Fig. 4) and hands it, together with the cash receipts, to
the Steward or other authorized recipient. The latter counts the cash
immediately, checks it on the clerk’s report and places it one side until the
total cash is checked. He then transfers the item to his own Form 4,
(Fig. 5) and compares the totals for each department with the cash register
readings for those departments, entering the latter, if they are shown
separately for each clerk, on each clerk’s report in the spaces provided for
that purpose. Discrepancies are handled as previously explained under
Charge Sales.</p>

<h3>Cash Book.</h3>

<p>When the cash is checked and the Steward’s report is correct, he copies
the amounts of cash sales for each department into the Cash Book, putting
each amount in its proper column. All the cash receipts from all the departments
for any one day go on the same line in the Cash Book. On the
other hand, credit nothing in the Cash Book to a department except a cash
sale. Every other receipt of cash from whatever source is recorded in the
Cash Book, also, a separate line being given to each transaction. For instance,
as before explained, whenever one of our charge customers pays his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
bill, we give him a separate line in the Cash Book, entering this amount in
two columns, first under “Net Cash” and also under “Customers”.</p>

<p>The Cash Book should have on the “Received” or debit side (the left
side) columns for the following items:—Date, Explanation, Vou., Net Cash,
a column for each department of the Exchange, Customers, Creditors, Interest
and Discount, and at least two spare columns for entering the pay-day
collections, etc. The books should not be too bulky as many cash
books are, and should, of course, be built on the loose leaf plan. A cash
book cannot be designed to suit all cases because of the varying number
and kind of departments pertaining to different Exchanges. However, it
is easy to secure uniformity of principle and method, which is the main
thing. The only point that need vary between different Exchanges is the
number of columns in the book and the headings to same.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/figure11.jpg" width="500" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 11. (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p>A cash book will be rather expensive if we have it made precisely as
we want it, especially if we have the column headings printed in. There is
no doubt that printed headings make a neater book, but in many cases, the
advisability of incurring the extra expense is open to doubt. Considering
the great variety of stock pages published by various manufacturers, there
is rarely an excuse for ordering specially ruled and printed sheets. Special
ruling are very expensive, especially when we can order but a small supply.
It is found that the sheets shown in Fig. 11 give perfect satisfaction. The
lower sample, having 20 columns, will take care of almost any Exchange,
and by trimming off the two outer columns of the right hand page, we can secure
a capacity of 36 columns. This would prevent us from keeping Cash Received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and Cash Disbursed on pages that confront each other, but as the
number of pages used for the former usually exceeds greatly those necessary
for the latter, this objection has little weight. If convenience so dictated,
there is no reason why the two sides of the Cash Book or Cash
Account could not be kept in different parts of the book or even in separate
books. This would lead to economy of pages.</p>

<p>The upper of the two forms shown in Fig. 11 would be suitable for small
Exchanges where a large number of columns are not required, as the left
hand side could be used for cash received and the right for cash disbursed.
Several of the right hand pages would have to be wasted each month on
account of the greater number of entries on the debit side. Some Exchanges
use a form similar to the upper one of Fig. 11 except that it is
printed and ruled to order and contains a greater number of columns than
that shown in the cut. The writer knows of one Exchange that has as
many as twenty columns on each side of its Cash Book. Such forms, however,
are exceedingly expensive and should be considered more or less of a
luxury. The forms shown in Fig. 11 cost $1.75 per hundred retail (without
printed headings) and measure 11 × 14 inches, being 11 inches on the
binding side. A sectional post binder to fit any number of these sheets can
be obtained for $3.25 retail.</p>

<p>The Cash Book is used to give a detailed record of all cash transactions.
On the left hand or debit side is entered all cash received and on
the right hand or credit side is entered all cash paid out; the difference in
the sum totals of the respective sides showing at any time the amount of
cash on hand. All items on the credit side of the Cash Book are posted to
the debit side of some account in the Ledger and vice versa. (Bank
drafts, sight drafts and checks belong in the cash account; notes and time
drafts belong to Bills Receivable and Bills Payable accounts.) Our posting
is done only when the books are closed, at the end of the month or
when necessity arises, thus saving an enormous amount of work. As we
keep no <em>private</em> ledger account for each of our creditors or customers, it
follows that the totals of each column in our Cash Book are posted as
lump sums to the credit of or as a debit against the ledger accounts of Bills
Receivable, Bills Payable, or one of the Exchange’s departments, etc. All
miscellaneous receipts that do not properly belong to one of the departments,
customers, etc., are taken up under “Interest and Discounts”.</p>

<p>An important advantage of this method of handling our cash sales is
that we are preparing, as we go along, all the data that will be required by
the Inspector. A discussion of the Credit side of the Cash Book is postponed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
until the subject of Purchase Records is taken up. The above described
operations are shown graphically in Fig. 12, where the heavy lines
represent operations of recording or posting and the dotted lines show
possible checking operations. The item of “Other Cash” is, of course,
checked against Form 25, Form 6, or elsewhere, depending upon circumstances.</p>

</div>

<p>Coupons, as it may be superfluous to explain, are credit slips sold to
enlisted men by the Exchange. They are sold on credit, being secured by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
notes signed by the purchasers; these notes constituting a lawful lien on
the drawer’s pay are supposed to be redeemed at the next pay day. The
credit slips can be used at any time for purchasing articles at the Exchange.
Exchanges formerly used metal coins or “checks” for this purpose, but it
was considered inadvisable to permit credit to be so easily counterfeited,
transferred, etc., hence the use of paper coupons has become universal,
being covered by mandatory orders in certain circumstances.</p>

<h3>Kinds of Coupons.</h3>

<p>There are two classes of coupons, the first being the well known
“Coupon Book” shown in Fig. 13. These books are made in various denominations
ranging from one to five dollars. They are composed of a
cover and several interior pages, the latter being divided by perforations
into five coupons each, representing values of five, ten or twenty-five cents,
depending upon the value of the book. For instance, a $1.00 book contains
three sheets, two composed of five 5c coupons each and one composed of
five 10c coupons. On the cover of each book is printed the serial number
of the book, its value and blank lines for the insertion of the signature of
the person to whom issued, the signature of the Exchange Officer and the
date of issue. It is also customary to have printed on the cover the words
“Not Transferable”. In some cases, on the back cover of each book is
printed a promissory note which, after being signed by the soldier, is torn
off and kept by the Exchange authorities until the value of the book is
collected in cash from the soldier. A variation of this scheme is to have a
separate sheet in each book so printed that it will perform a like function.
In either case, it is expected that when the book is depleted, the clerk
making the last sale shall take up the cover of the book in order that it may
be filed in the Exchange for such period as the Exchange Officer shall
determine. This, for the reason that sometimes a man will claim that,
although he signed up for certain coupons at a certain time, he failed actually
to receive the coupons. The possession and production by the
Exchange of these used-up covers are conclusive evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>These coupon books have certain inherent defects that are more or
less serious. In the first place, it is found that they can be used as stakes
in gambling games and can also be sold or otherwise transferred by the
original drawer. This is objectionable, not merely because it is against
regulations, but also because the person who so receives the coupons is not
apt to draw coupons of his own, thus tending to curtail the amount of
coupon sales transacted by the Exchange. This transferring of coupons
can be accomplished in several ways. In large garrisons it will take a little
time before the clerks will know each man by sight, especially when there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
is an influx of recruits. If a customer is not known to the clerks, he might
be able to use another soldier’s coupon book unless the clerk should require
him to write his name and compare it with the signature on the book
presented. This would be impracticable at certain times of the month
when the coupon sales were heavy, as it would consume too much time,
thus preventing the clerks from waiting upon other customers as promptly
as they should. It is evident that this kind of a transfer could be effected
with <em>any</em> kind of coupons, and there is no preventive except to have the
clerks become acquainted with every man in the garrison at the earliest
practicable moment. When there is time, the clerks should, in doubtful
cases, require the customer to write his name and then compare it with the
name signed on the book. All clerks should understand that when any
person presents a coupon book not his own the book is forfeited to the
Exchange and the occurrence is to be reported to the Exchange Officer.</p>

<p>Another way in which coupons can be transferred (unless each coupon
is numbered to correspond to the cover) is as follows:—Private A borrows
from Private B fifty cents in cash and gives him a dollar coupon book
in exchange. Private B removes the staple which binds this book together,
takes the book apart and throws away the cover. He then loosens the
staple in a book which he himself has drawn at the Exchange and carefully
inserts enough of the loose coupon sheets from A’s book to fill it up
again, and bends the staple back into its original position. This scheme is
of wider prevalence than most Exchange Officers would imagine, and it is
very hard to detect.</p>

<p>Another fault to be found with the coupon book lies in the possibility
of there being a wrong number of sheets of coupons in it. Printers are
but human and it sometimes happens that there are too few or too many
coupons in a book. Unless this is detected before issue, it causes an error
in our statement of coupons outstanding. To prevent this, it is necessary
to examine each book before issuing it, (even before handing them over to
the coupon clerk), a tedious operation, one which consumes unnecessary
time and labor.</p>

<p>In most Exchanges, the conviction sooner or later arises that there are
coupons outstanding of which the Exchange has no record. This may
occur through the suspicion that some person has acquired coupons in some
unauthorized manner. When such cases arise, it is customary to place the
Exchange Officer’s signature on the backs of the coupons or to employ
some secret mark. This is a laborious and expensive operation and should
not be resorted to unless necessary. In justice to our printers, be it said
that they use every endeavor to prevent coupons from falling into unauthorized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
hands, but Exchange Officers, if inexperienced, do not always
appreciate the importance of taking like precautions. All coupon books
should be kept in a place that is absolutely secure, and nobody should have
access to same, except the Exchange Officer himself. He should use every
effort to prevent a single book from reaching his customers except in the
regular way. He should take from the coupon vault only enough books to
supply the demand, and they should be carefully accounted for by the
clerk who issues them to the men.</p>

<p>Some Exchange Officers use a fac-simile stamp instead of countersigning
each book in person. If this is done, the stamp should be most
carefully guarded, and kept in the personal possession of the Exchange
Officer. When the stamp is made, there should be incorporated in it, some
secret mark, otherwise, any person could secure another similar stamp, to
the possible loss of the Exchange. This secret mark should be in the
nature of a double instead of a single period or some other inconspicuous
mark that would probably not “take” well should any person attempt to
produce a second fac-simile from an impression of the genuine stamp.</p>

<p>The second type of coupon, shown in Fig. 14, corrects some of the
faults of the coupon book. In the first place, it is much cheaper, the first
order being about one-half and subsequent orders costing about one-third
of the price of the coupon books. This is an important saving because the
cost of coupons is a dead loss to the Exchange, and if a satisfactory coupon
can be obtained at a low cost, it should be used as a matter of course, and
the overhead charges correspondingly reduced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/figure14.jpg" width="325" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 14.</p>
</div>

<p>As will be noted, these coupons consist of a single sheet of stamps or
coupons, separated by slot perforations, the whole sheet containing twenty
5c coupons. Considerable experience in this line prompts the statement
that no real advantage is gained by having coupon books of denominations
higher than one dollar. The style of coupon here illustrated makes a
virtue of this fact and all slips are ordinarily made in the one dollar
denomination only. In counting up the coupons after the day’s work, we
know that, regardless of colors, each coupon represents 5c. Another beauty
of the scheme is that it is practically impossible to have strips containing a
wrong number of coupons, the method of manufacture almost precluding
such a possibility, thus obviating the laborious checking process. Still another
advantage is that the whole dollar’s worth of coupons is printed on a
single piece of paper, thus preventing any addition to its value, as is possible
with the book when partially depleted. One might think that the
smaller size of these coupons would make them hard to handle and
count, but an officer of considerable experience in this line of work states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
that by using the rubber end of a pencil they can be counted with more
facility than can the other style of coupons. Some Exchanges would probably
require each strip to have attached to it a detachable stub on which
the soldier would be required to receipt for the coupons and also promise
to pay for them at next pay day. In this case, as in the case of the coupon
books, such practice merely adds unnecessary work and serves no useful
purpose. On pay-day, we should have to handle one such stub for every
dollar’s worth of coupons that each soldier had drawn; each of these stubs
or cards would then have to be stamped “Paid” and returned to the soldier.
This is not an efficient method.</p>

<p>Whichever style of coupon is decided upon for use should be printed
on stock of various colors and coupons of one color only should be issued
until it is desirable to have a check on our outstanding coupons. (Of
course, if the books are used, it will be necessary to have the 5c and the 10c
coupons of different colors.) The color should then be shifted and when
coupons of the old color cease appearing, we can arrive at an approximate
check on our outstanding coupon account. We say “approximate” because
it sometimes happens that a man puts away a whole or a partially used
book in a garment and thus inadvertently retires it from circulation for a
space of time that may stretch into months. Of course, this could be prevented
by issuing a notice that all coupons must be presented before a certain
time, and that after that time, no coupons of the old colors would be
accepted. This would give us a fresh starting point as regards our outstanding
coupons, but such a proceeding should be resorted to only under
the most serious circumstances, because it savours somewhat of a person
refusing payment on a draft. When, however, there is good reason to
believe that our Coupons Outstanding account is incorrect, such a step
should be taken immediately, as it is about the only practical way in which
we can correct the account—a very important one.</p>

<h3>Regulations Concerning Coupons.</h3>

<p>Before explaining at length the system of handling coupon sales advocated
herein, it may be well to examine the regulations with which we must
comply. First, comes par. 15, G. O. 176, W. D., 1909, which reads as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“15. <i>Sales on Credit.</i> When the commanding officer and council are
agreed that it is to the true interest of the command, the former may authorize
a credit at the exchange to any soldier in good standing to an
amount not exceeding in any one month one-third of his monthly pay.
This will be given upon the request of the soldier, in writing, approved by
his company commander, and these credit checks will be carried on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
accounts of the exchange as “bills receivable” until paid. Soldiers granted
credit will be distinctly informed that they must make prompt and unsolicited
payment to the exchange officer on next pay day. Defaulters will
be debarred the privileges of the exchange and are liable to trial and punishment.
It is the duty of the soldier who has been given credit to pay
the amount as soon as he receives his pay, and the exchange officer will be
present at the place of payment to receive the money or make such arrangements
as will facilitate the payment. Credit will not ordinarily be extended
to a soldier between the date of last payment on rolls before discharge
and the date of discharge. When the debt has remained unpaid
one pay day on which the soldier was paid a balance sufficient to discharge
such debt and no other means of collection is practicable, the exchange officer
will notify the company or detachment commander, who will note the
amount on the next pay rolls as “Due Post Exchange —— ——” and on
succeeding rolls until the debt has been collected, or until it is apparent
that it can not be collected, when the credit check will be turned over to
the company or detachment in lieu of so much cash at the next distribution
of profits as provided in paragraph 17.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the opinion of many, it is unfortunate that an arbitrary limitation
of credit has been fixed as shown in the first sentence of the above quoted
paragraph, as it tends to work a hardship upon some of our most valuable
soldiers. Most of our older non-commissioned officers and N. C. staff
officers are married and spend most of their pay for articles that are carried
in stock by well equipped Exchanges, such as meats, groceries, etc.
It is not always convenient or even possible for them to pay cash for
purchases, and there is no doubt that they would do a much larger business
with the Exchange if greater credit were allowed them. It is a well
established custom to extend reasonable credit to all commissioned officers;
it would seem but just to extend a proportionate amount of credit to such
N.C.O.’s as might be vouched for by their respective organization commanders.
It is hoped that this limitation may be modified, but until that
occurs, the Exchange Officer has no discretion in the matter and should be
careful to avoid any infraction of the general rule.</p>

<p>The second sentence of par. 15 also merits more than a passing glance.
It requires a previous request “in writing” by the soldier before credit
coupons can be issued him, and the request must be approved by his company
commander. It is not specifically stated that this request must be
renewed every month, nor is the writer aware that this point has ever been
decided. We may, therefore, assume, when any man has once made this
written request, that credit to the amount of one-third of his monthly pay
be extended to him, that he need not formally renew this request monthly.
Should this interpretation prove fallacious, we must have the consolidated
request (Form 25, to be described hereafter) signed by the men monthly.
If this is done, the list should be signed at the same time as the pay rolls, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
save trouble for the men. It is found that when there is an unnecessary
amount of “red tape” connected with the operation of securing credit
coupons, the men will (perhaps unconsciously) tend to shun the process,
with consequent loss of business to the Exchange. There is every reason
why we should make it as easy as possible for everybody to transact
business with the Exchange and any unnecessary stumbling blocks should
be carefully searched out and removed. The Exchange should be run on
the same general principles which govern a civilian store, and if the latter
subjected its customers to petty annoyances of any kind, it would soon be
driven out of business by lack of trade.</p>

<p>Returning to paragraph 15, it might be remarked that perhaps the best
way in which the men can be “distinctly informed that they must make
prompt and unsolicited payment”, is by incorporating this statement on the
receipt which they sign when the coupons are issued to them. Beside the
other matter contained in par. 15, we should note par. 13 and par. 14 (c) and
(e) of the same order. They read as follows:—</p>

<p>“13. <i>Checks or Coupons.</i> The use of checks or coupons representing
values, and exchangeable for merchandise or other charges at the exchange,
is <em>encouraged</em> merely; but care should be taken that these checks
are not disposed of to unauthorized persons, and to provide against this,
they should never be redeemed in cash. When permitted by the commanding
officer, they should be sold by the exchange officer and regarded as a
liability until redeemed.</p>

<p>“The coupon-book system of extending credit to enlisted men will be
used by all exchanges conducted at posts where more than two organizations
are stationed, except at temporary stations and at places where conditions
of service have made it impracticable to procure the coupon books.</p>

<p>“These coupon books will bear the name of the enlisted man to whom
issued and will be honored at the exchange only when presented by the
enlisted man whose name appears on the book.”</p>

<p>“14 (c). <i>Bills Receivable (Enlisted Men).</i>—To show the value of
checks issued to enlisted men, and the amount of cash received from them
in payment of their due bills. When checks are issued, the entry will be
‘Cash, Dr. to Bills Receivable.’ The difference between the two sides of
the account will show the amount of due bills on hand unpaid.” (Par. II,
G. O. 201/09.)</p>

<p>“14 (e). <i>Check Account.</i>—To show the amount of checks outstanding.
When the checks are issued, this account will be credited as above,
thus, ‘Bills Receivable, Dr. to Checks.’ The amount of checks received
each day for merchandise will be charged to the account, thus, ‘Checks, Dr.
to Merchandise.’ The difference between the two sides will show the
amount of checks outstanding.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Note that the outstanding coupons are a <em>liability</em>, as they may be presented
as a claim against the Exchange at any time. Of course, the receipts
which the men have given us for these coupons, in other words,
their notes promising to pay us for the coupons, are an <em>asset</em> and should
be carried under Bills Receivable. Some Exchanges call such assets “Bills
Receivable, Credit Coupons”, thus differentiating them from such as Bills
Receivable, Charge Accounts or Bills Receivable, Laundry Coupons.</p>

<p>Paragraph 14 (c) and (e) translated into non-technical language
simply means that when we issue coupon books of a certain value to the
men, we must enter this amount on the left hand or debit side of our
“Bills Receivable” account in the Ledger, thus charging up “Mr. Bills
Receivable”, as it is sometimes explained, with a certain amount for which
he must account. Now, as the Ledger is to be kept according to the double
entry system, we must obey the fundamental principle of this system,
which is, “for every account that is charged (debited) a certain amount
we must credit some other account with the same amount”, hence the
name, double entry. In view of these facts, therefore, we turn to our
Check Account—or Outstanding Coupons, if you prefer to call it so, and
<em>credit</em> this account with the same amount that we charged against Bills
Receivable. When we receive the cash for the men’s notes at pay day, we
<em>credit</em> “Mr. Bills Receivable” with the amount taken in, thus clearing him
of this amount and making him no longer responsible for it. We have
previously, of course, entered this amount on the debit side of the Cash
Book, for the same reason noted above. When the coupons are presented
by the men in payment for articles purchased by them, we <em>credit</em> “Merchandise”
(or the proper department of the Exchange, if departments are
used) with the amount taken in. This, for the reason that said department
is no longer accountable for that amount of merchandise; we must, therefore
credit that department with the proper amount and charge or debit it
against the outstanding coupon or Check account. It must be remembered
that outstanding coupons are a liability against us and are in the nature of
bills payable—except that they are payable only in merchandise. Hence, if
we consider this account as a living person—one of our creditors—it will
appear more logical when we place to his credit everything we owe him,
i. e., the coupons we have given him, and to charge him the value of the
merchandise he has obtained from us in return.</p>

<p>The above prolix explanation will sound puerile to an experienced
accountant; it is not written for him, but for the inexperienced man with
little or no knowledge of scientific book-keeping, who is trying to work
this system or one like it. The writer knows from bitter experience how
hard it is to avoid some of the unexpected pit-falls of double entry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Now we are in a position to describe the manner of handling our
coupon sales, starting from the very beginning.</p>

<h3>Issuing Coupons.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/figure15.jpg" width="700" height="475" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 15. (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p>The first thing to be done is to have the various organizations submit
their lists of men who are entitled to credit at the Exchange. This is
usually done a few days after pay day, it being the excellent custom in
most Exchanges to issue no coupons until about five days after, in order
to attract some of the cash that is apt to be plentiful for only a few days.
One of the best forms for such a list known to the writer is Form 25,
shown in Fig. 15. It measures 9 × 20 inches and may be punched to fit a
loose leaf file. It is faint ruled horizontally six lines to the inch in order
to fit typewriter spacing. The length of this form enables a whole company
of 110 men to be entered on its face, without resorting to the necessity
of turning a page. In garrisons where the organizations are uniformly
smaller, the length of the form can be correspondingly reduced. Each
organization fills out one of these sheets on a typewriter, entering the
names of the men in pay roll order in column 3. In column 2 is entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the rank of each man, and in column 4 is entered the amount of credit he
desires, which must not exceed one-third of his pay. The men sign their
names in column 1 and in space A is printed the statement to which they
subscribe—that they request credit to the amount of one-third of their pay
and that they promise to pay for their coupons on the pay day after drawing
same, etc. This list is then sent to the Exchange at the regular time,
preferably a day or two before coupons are to be issued.</p>

<p>There is a point in this connection that sometimes causes trouble, due
to the fact that pay day never comes on the first of the month. There are
two ways of handling the situation. The first is to have the companies
submit their lists to the Exchange on the first of the month and the
Exchange issue coupons on this authority until the last of the same month
with the exception of the five days after pay day, during which time, no
coupons are issued. The men pay for the coupons on the pay day which
occurs in the succeeding month. The principal objection to this method is
that if a man draws his full allowance of coupons on or near the first of
every month, he would, if he deserted a few days before pay day, cause
the Exchange a loss of <em>twice</em> his monthly allowance. The second way of
proceeding obviates this defect: it consists in having the companies submit
their lists a few days after each pay day. The Exchange issues coupons
on this authority and all of these coupons are supposed to be paid on the
pay day which winds up this period. Therefore, it is seen that the Exchange
runs a smaller chance of loss, or rather, the chances are that the
loss will be smaller.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 16, Actual size</p>
</div>

<p>Upon receiving these lists, the coupon clerk at the Exchange takes a
supply of Form 19, shown in Fig. 16, and enters the names of the men at
the top of these cards, one card for each man who is entitled to credit.
This work can be done at odd moments during the month. It is also a
good plan to enter the amount of credit to which the man is entitled.
This data should be entered at the very top of the card where it will catch
the eye. These cards are 3 × 5 inches, specially printed; they fit into the
filing cabinet, to be described later. One standard drawer 15½ inches long
will hold enough cards to take care of a six company post. The cards
should be of fairly good writing stock, but no thicker than is necessary to
insure ease of handling. They can be obtained from any job printer, but
care should be exercised that they measure precisely 3 × 5 inches, otherwise,
they will prove very troublesome to run over rapidly in the drawer, because
some will be larger than others. Plain cards of this size can be
bought at $1.50 per thousand from regular dealers. All cards pertaining
to any one company are behind an index card bearing on its tab the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
designation of that company. It is also a convenience to have a set of
alphabetical guides for each company, as they facilitate finding and filing
the cards. After any of these cards receives a record, it is highly important
that it not be lost or stolen, so the drawer containing them should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
locked except when actually in use. When any man applies for coupon
books at the Exchange, he signs his name in the space provided on the
card, the clerk adds his own initials as witness, stamps in the date and
enters in ink or indelible pencil (or preferably by means of a rubber
stamp) the amount of the coupons issued. If the clerk does not recognize
the man, he compares his signature with the same man’s signature on Form
25, which he should have near him for this purpose and to see that the
man does not overdraw his allowance. He also requires the man to sign
his name on the stub of the coupon slip or the cover of the coupon book
issued. In addition, the clerk should have at hand a strip of paper on
which he has entered in rotation along the left hand margin the serial numbers
of the coupons he has on hand. Such a strip can be struck off on
the adding machine. As coupons are issued, the clerk should enter opposite
each number, the name of the man to whom it was issued. He can do
this while the man is signing the coupons, so no time is wasted. In the
evening, this strip is given to the Steward or cashier and the total value
of coupons issued is entered in the proper place on the Steward’s daily
report (Form 4, Fig. 5). The record of this strip is checked by comparison
with the number of coupons left in the possession of the coupon
clerk.</p>

<p>It is found in practice that Form 19 contains sufficient space for
noting the transactions of any month, for very few men will draw coupons
as many as six times during the month. It will be noted that this scheme
does not contemplate restricting the men to but one drawing during the
month, as is the practice in some places. The Exchange loses trade by
such methods, and much better results are obtained by permitting the men
to draw when they please.</p>

<p>When the end of the month arrives, the coupon clerk disregards it by
continuing to use the same set of cards right along until 24 hours before
pay day occurs. (It should be understood by the whole garrison that no
coupons will be issued during this time, in order to allow the coupon clerk
to work up his pay table collection sheets). By means of an assistant, the
coupon clerk transfers the total of the coupons shown on each Form 19 to
column 10 on Form 25 opposite the name of the man to whom that particular
Form 19 refers. As fractional parts of a dollar are not issued, $5.00
can be abbreviated to “5”. At the same time, the coupon clerk reads off
the totals of any unpaid cards that have been carried from the preceding
month, these figures being entered in the same manner in columns 5, 6 or 7,
as the case may be. It will be noted that these cards have no place for
“brought forward” entries. This is unnecessary labor and is therefore
omitted. It is no argument against such a practice to ask what would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
happen if one of the old unpaid cards became lost, because we might
ask the same question concerning the current cards. The answer lies in
the fact that the checking system will take care of such cases. In this instance,
columns 5, 6 and 7 are checked back to the Forms 25 pertaining to
the preceding month.</p>

<p>It will be noted that our Form 25 makes provision for entering Laundry
charges and has in addition a spare blank column for such miscellaneous
collections as may be found desirable. The particulars of the Laundry
entries will be dilated upon later. When the amounts that the various
men of any organization owe to the Exchange have been entered in their
proper columns, each line is added across and the totals due from each man
entered in the proper column. Each column is then totaled on the adding
machine and the footings checked by comparing the total of the total
column with the sum of the totals of the other columns. If they agree,
that sheet is ready for payment, and a like process is instituted with the
other sheets. These sheets and the Forms 19 are the only papers that need
be taken to the pay table.</p>

<h3>Pay Table Procedure.</h3>

<p>It may be just as well to discuss this point here, because it is related to
our coupon sales more closely than to anything else.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to make sure there is available a plentiful
supply of change. Where there is no bank convenient to the post and the
men receive their money from a paymaster, he will sometimes agree to
bring with him an amount of change sufficient for the needs of the Post
Exchange, but if there is a bank available, we should hesitate before imposing
upon the good nature of the paymaster to this extent. It is a great
convenience to the men to have their ten dollar bills “changed”, and no
Post Exchange should demur when the men offer such bills in payment of
their debts. We must always remember that the principal reason why the
Exchange exists is to be a convenience to the enlisted man.</p>

<p>There should be three persons at the Exchange table on pay days; the
Exchange Officer to personally receive the cash and make change, the
Steward or book-keeper to read from Forms 25 the amount each man
owes, and a clerk to check this reading with the men’s notes (Form 19),
cancel them and deliver same to the men. A non-commissioned officer of
the organization being paid is stationed beside the Steward to identify the
men. He calls to the Steward the names of the men as they come up, the
Steward calls off the amount that each man owes, the latter gives the
money to the Exchange Officer. The clerk has meanwhile checked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
total amount covered by Form 19 with the amount read off by the Steward,
stamped the card “Paid” and placed it in front of the Exchange Officer for
his inspection. The latter then gives the card to the man with his change
and the incident is closed. It is usually found advisable to have a selected
non-commissioned officer detailed to see that all men report at the Exchange
table.</p>

<p>After payment is finished, the clerk should total the value of the cards
he still holds for each organization and subtract it from the total shown by
the proper Form 25. The sum of all these remainders should equal the
amount of cash actually taken in at the Exchange table. This check should
always be made, and at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that a man pays for his coupons before pay day;
he may have been discharged or transferred, etc. In such a case this fact
should be stamped on Form 25 and the total of such amounts deducted at
the bottom of the sheet before going to the pay table. The amount of
such payments should also be entered on the debit side of the Cash Book
as “Pvt. Jones, Co. A, ... $3.00 ... $3.00”, the sums coming under
the net cash and the credit coupons columns respectively. If he also paid
$1.40 for laundry work done, this entry would be “Pvt. Jones, Co. A, ...
$4.40 ... $3.00 ... $1.40”, the sums coming under net cash, credit coupons
and laundry coupons respectively. The amounts collected at the
pay table are entered in the Cash Book in the same way, all on one line. At
the end of the month or when the books are closed, the total of the credit
coupons column is posted as a lump sum to the credit of the Bills Receivable.
Credit Coupons account in the Ledger and the Laundry collections
are handled in the same way.</p>

<p>Having traced this branch of the coupon business to its end, let us
retrace our steps and follow another branch until we come to the same
goal, the Ledger.</p>

<h3>Coupon Sales.</h3>

<p>When the men receive their coupons, they use them for purchasing
articles from the Exchange. The clerk making a coupon sale should identify
the man making the purchase and make sure he is using his own
coupons. He should also satisfy himself that there is no fraud, forgery,
etc., connected with the coupons. These two operations are ordinarily instantaneous,
requiring no waste of time whatever. The clerk then gives
the purchaser the desired articles, tears off a corresponding value in coupons
and drops them in his private drawer or compartment, meanwhile
ringing up the sale on the cash register and giving the purchaser the receipt
printed by the register.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/figure17.jpg" width="700" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 17, (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p>After the day’s work
is over, each clerk
handles his coupon sales
in the same manner as
previously described for
charge sales, and they
are checked by the Steward
as before. The latter
enters on his Form 4,
(Fig. 5) the amount of
coupon sales made by
each clerk, also, the total
amount of coupons issued
during the day.
All these coupon transactions
for any one day
are then entered on a
single line of Form 26
(Fig. 17) which is the
same as that used for
Form 7. As will be noted
from an inspection of
the cut, the coupons issued
are entered in column
A and the total receipts
from all departments
are entered in column
B. These receipts
are distributed among
the department as shown,
the value carried in column
B equalling the sum
of the amounts carried in
the columns to the right.</p>

<p>Each Form 26 refers
solely to one month’s
transactions, there are no
“brought forward” items.
At the end of the month
or whenever the books
are closed, all of the columns
on this form are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
footed up and the totals checked across. The total of column A should agree
with the strip record which the coupon clerk has been keeping as previously
described. The detailed process of checking this account will be described
later, but it is evident that if the Steward has made out his daily reports
(Form 4) correctly, and correctly copied the coupon records to Form 26,
there can be no error in the latter statement. After successfully withstanding
the checking process, the total of column A is posted as a lump sum to the
debit side of “Bills Receivable, Credit Accounts” in the Ledger, writing the
entry thus:—“Aug. 31 Credit Coupons $54.00”. It will be remembered
that we must also credit this amount to the Outstanding Coupon account.
We now transfer the total of the Store column to the Store Account in our
Ledger, entering on the right hand or credit side, “Aug. 31 Coupon
sales $8.15”. We proceed in like manner with our other departments.
The total of column B must, of course, be charged (debited) against the
Outstanding Coupon account in the Ledger.</p>

<p>A summary of all these operations is shown graphically in Fig. 18.
The solid lines show how a record is carried through the books until it
arrives at the Ledger. The dotted lines show the various checking operations
that are possible. Attention is especially invited to checking Forms
25 and 26 against each other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/figure18.jpg" width="500" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 18.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>In leaving the subject, it is deemed proper to state that the Exchange
Officer should keep a single entry record of all unused coupons on hand.
When they are first received from the printer, he should carefully check
them in person and see that they are safely stored. His record of them should
show the numbers and colors of the coupons and exactly how many of the
various colors he has on hand at any time.</p>

<p>Coupons should be issued at a fixed time daily, and the Exchange Officer
should see to it that the men are never disappointed, but are always
able to secure their coupons at the specified time.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="STOCK_RECORDS">STOCK RECORDS.</h2>

<h3>In General.</h3>

<p>One of the most important points connected with the running of any
store, is that referring to the manner in which the records of the stock are
kept. In most Exchanges, the stock records are not good; usually, because
a clumsy or inefficient system of records is in force. An endeavor will be
made in the description to be given hereafter to set forth a system whereby
misuse of stock will be prevented and an accurate estimate of the profits
made by each department will be possible. The objection may be made to
this system that in a large exchange it would require the services of one
clerk to keep the stock records alone, but when we realize that an inefficient
stock record can and usually does result in losses that are sometimes much
greater in value than this clerk’s wages, we see the futility of such an argument.
It is useless to try to avoid the conclusion that we <em>must</em> keep
accurate track of our merchandise. In an exchange at, say, a 5-company
post, it is economy to pay one man $100.00 per month or even more, to
take exclusive charge of the stock records.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is essential to make clear in the minds of the
Exchange authorities the difference between a stock room and a store
room. The former is for storing merchandise that is bought in large
quantities and will not be needed in the various departments for some time.
The merchandise in the stock room is charged to it on the Stock Records
until it is needed in one of the departments when it is sent to and its value
charged against that department and credited to the stock room. A store
room in the sense now considered is a place in which we may store the
merchandise belonging to and already charged against any department.
This “place” may be but a corner or a shelf in the stock room or any other
room. As a general rule, it is best to charge merchandise direct to the
proper department, as it saves time and work. Then, if the department
concerned finds that it is inconvenient to keep this merchandise on its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
counters or shelves, it can transfer some of it to the proper store room
until needed. Both the stock room and the store rooms should be under
the jurisdiction of the stock clerk, the former exclusively so. Efficient
locks should be provided for these rooms and he or his agent should be the
only persons authorized to handle the stock therein.</p>

<p>The stock record is simply a stock ledger in which we keep accurate
account of the numbers of articles acquired and dispensed. If practicable,
it should show at all times the exact number of each article that we have
on hand. Such a record is sometimes called a “Perpetual Inventory”. It
would not be practicable in the usual case for us to keep such a record in
post exchange business for the reason that it would be extravagant for us
to record each cash or coupon sale made during the day. For example,
during certain days of the month, such as pay day and the first day upon
which coupons are issued, it is manifestly impracticable for us to make
out a sales slip for each cash or coupon purchase because there are so
many five and ten cent purchases that the cost in time and labor involved
in such a method would outweigh the advantages gained. If the average
sale amounted to a dollar or so, it might pay us to use sales slips similar
to those used in recording our charge sales. Therefore, most Exchanges do
not require cash or coupon sales to be recorded except on the cash register.
Hence, there is no itemized record of the merchandise that is sold during
the day for cash or for coupons, which in turn makes it impossible to keep
a perpetual inventory. The result is that an inventory must be taken at
least once a month.</p>

<p>If we now take such an inventory and calculate the selling price of all
the goods found, the result will represent the receipts each department
should turn in if they sold out all of their stock. If we keep adding to
this amount the selling price of all merchandise that we receive for and
issue to the departments for sale, and deduct the selling price of all
articles which each department turns in to the stock room, we shall have,
at the end of the month, figures which represent the receipts which should
be turned in if each department were to “sell out”. By subtracting from
these amounts the actual receipts turned in during the month, we find the
selling price of the articles which <em>should</em> be on hand at the end of the
month. By taking an inventory at the end of the month and figuring out
the selling value of the articles actually found, we can check the operations
of our various departments. If there is any great discrepancy, it would
show that our clerks are, in effect, taking articles from our shelves and the
Exchange is not getting the benefit of its sales. It is not to be expected
that these amounts will agree to the cent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Now if there is but one clerk in any department, it is easy to fasten
the responsibility for any shortage, but where there are several, special
steps must be taken in order to do this. Suppose we have four clerks in
the store department; if they sell from the various shelves indiscriminately,
or if one or more of them are sometimes away on duty, it would be manifestly
unjust to hold any particular clerk or even all of them responsible
for any shortages which might occur. The only solution lies in sub-dividing
the store into sections, putting one clerk in sole charge of each and
allow no clerk to touch the stock in another man’s section. In case a
clerk in unavoidably absent, an inventory of his section can be made in a
few minutes, and, if the results at the end of the month show it to be
desirable, checked against the sales he had made. In this way, both the
clerk and the Exchange are protected. A “roving” clerk or the Steward
can take the place of the absentee in case of necessity. Heavy sellers like
tobacco and the like can be placed in the sections of two or more clerks,
thus taking care of pay day rushes. Unless some such scheme is adopted
it will be absolutely impossible to fix the responsibility for any loss the
Exchange may incur.</p>

<p>Those departments which are, in effect, “manufacturing” departments,
such as the lunch room, meat market, etc., also require special treatment,
especially in the matter of figuring the selling price of merchandise issued
to them.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the honesty of the stock clerk must be
above suspicion. In case a civilian is employed, it is good policy—in fact, it
should be considered imperative that he be required to execute a bond for
the faithful performance of his duties.</p>

<p>With the above general explanation of the broad principles of this
particular system, we are now prepared to discuss it more in detail. It
seems generally conceded that the stock records can be kept most easily,
cheaply and efficiently by means of the card index system. The present
regulations, previously cited, specify an “inventory <em>book</em>”, and inspectors
are prone to interpret the regulations literally. It makes little difference
in our case which method is used, except that the card system is more
efficient, as before stated. The handling of the inventory book requires no
explanation, so, in order to provide for the time (which should be in the
near future) when the up-to-date card system of inventory is specifically
allowed in regulations, the following description is given. It is hoped that
it will prove a conclusive answer to those who ask, “But suppose you lose
a card.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<h3>Inventories of Stock.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/figure19.jpg" width="500" height="275" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 19, (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p>Let us start by taking an inventory of the stock we have on hand in
the stock room. We take a pack containing a known number of cards,
preferably numbered in sequence, like those shown in Fig. 19, and enter on
the top line the name of each article as we come to it; in the right upper
corner, the unit in which we sell it, whether pounds, bottles or what not;
and at the right of the uppermost data line, the number of such units
that we actually find on hand. We do this for each article in succession,
using a different card for each. If we have various grades of the same
kind of article (cigars, for instance) selling at different prices, a separate
card will, of course, be made out for each different grade. (Never sell the
same article at two different prices. For example, do not sell cigars for
“10 cents each, 3 for a quarter”. Sell them at either price and put in a
different brand of equal quality at the other price. It is proper to give
reduction on a sale of a box of cigars at a time, but sell them <em>from the
stock room</em> in such a case, and not from the store. Another way, permitting
sale from the department’s shelves, is by means of a discount slip,
which will be touched upon later. The first method, however, probably
suits our purposes best, especially when combined with the second.) The
cards mentioned above should be left with the articles to which they refer
until the inventory for that department is complete. We then look over
the shelves to see that there is a card with every article, thereby proving
that our inventory is complete, a point of superiority over the book form
of inventory. We then gather up and count the cards to make sure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
none are missing. The cards are then filed alphabetically behind a tabbed
index card referring to that department, or that particular section, if the
department is sub-divided. This same procedure is followed in taking inventory
of merchandise in the store, lunch room, etc., except that a different
colored card is used for each department. All sections of the same department
use cards of the same color. As each department will have more or
less merchandise in its store room, it will probably be best to take the
store room inventories first, then take the articles in the sales rooms. Enter
partial totals in pencil and the total in ink or indelible pencil on the first
line under the heading, “On Hand”, the date being entered at the left.
The number on hand, multiplied by the unit cost and selling prices, respectively,
will give the total cost and the total selling price of all the
articles on that card. For this purpose, the unit cost and selling prices
are entered at the upper left hand corner of each card. The total cost
prices are used in our inventories shown on our monthly statement, and
the total selling prices are used in our stock records only. In large exchanges,
these cards are not used again until the next inventory is taken,
so it is seen that they will last for several months.</p>

<h3>Merchandise Purchased.</h3>

<p>When merchandise arrives, it is cared for as described under “Purchase
Records” and when the total cost and selling values of the goods on
any invoice have been figured and transportation charges, etc., distributed,
the selling values are entered on Form 17, shown in Fig. 20. Two copies
of this form are used every day, one for cost prices and one for selling
prices. Each invoice requires but one line on each of these forms, so one
form is ordinarily ample for a day’s stock transactions. In the left hand
column is entered the number of the invoice and in the Dr. column pertaining
to each department is entered the selling price of all articles which
are covered by that particular invoice. The sum of all the values entered
in the Dr. columns on any one line should therefore equal the selling price
of all articles covered by the invoice whose number appears at the left.</p>

<p>This same procedure is followed with all invoices received, and therefore
covers all merchandise transactions. It will be noted that there are
no “Requisitions”, properly so-called, in cases like this where the incoming
goods are sent direct to a department. The department head receipts for
such goods by simply placing his name or initials in the right hand column
of the retained copy of our original order. (See Purchase Records.)
This simplified way of handling such a transaction saves an enormous
amount of unnecessary work, and is just as sound as the Requisition
System.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<h3>Transfers Between Departments.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/figure20.jpg" width="700" height="275" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 20, (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p>This proposition has
previously been mentioned,
but we purpose
now to show in detail
how such a transaction
is effected. Let us suppose
that the lunch room
needs a ham, and it is
desired to purchase same
from the market department.
Assume further
that the selling price of
this ham is $3.25. It is
evident that we must
first credit the market
with this amount. This
is done by means of a
“turn-in-card”, Form 12,
shown in Fig. 21.
The card is filled out as
shown, (the name of the
article is not essential),
is signed by the stock
clerk and is given to the
head of the market department
as a credit for
the ham, which is then
issued to the lunch room
man on a regular requisition.
The requisition
cards and the turn-in-cards
are precisely alike,
except that the latter are
printed in red ink. With
the exception of the signature,
therefore, Fig. 21
is also a reproduction of
the requisition upon
which the ham is issued
to the lunch room. These
cards are of standard
size, 3 × 5 inches, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of various colors, depending upon the color scheme adopted as described
under “Charge Sales”. Hence, we may assume that the market’s turn-in
card was printed in red on a buff card and the lunch room’s requisition
was printed in black on a salmon colored card. The cards can be bought
cheaply with “horizontal ruling”, thus cutting down some of the bill for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
specially printing the cards. It costs less to have the turn-in cards printed
in red than it would to have a special form of card printed, and they are
better, besides.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/figure21.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 21</p>
</div>

<p>In issuing the ham to the lunch room, the stock clerk should note on
the requisition, “Cr. Market”. He then enters the transaction on Form 17
as shown in Fig. 20. In all such transfers, the sum of the credits on any
line should, of course, equal the sum of the debits. It is not essential to
number these requisitions and turn-in slips because the date stamped at
the top is sufficient to enable us to identify any particular transaction.
The market man would hand in his credit slip to the Steward with his
daily report of sales. The stock clerk would hand in the requisition (receipted
by the lunch room man) with his Form 17 for that day.</p>

<p>There is still another transaction for which we must provide and that
is the operation of returning to our creditors goods which we have received
from them. This may arise through some defect in the merchandise
or through some other cause. Such a transaction is handled in exactly
the same manner as before. See entry opposite No. 7343 in Fig. 20 where
we have credited the store with $7.60. The goods were received on this
invoice and deduction made on same for this amount. If this invoice pertains
to an account already closed, we can make out an invoice of our
own, give it any desired number and give the store credit as before.</p>

<p>Goods which are returned to us by our customers are credited to their
accounts through the sales records as before described and do not affect
the working of the stock records. Wastage, breakage, etc., is credited to
departments by means of this same “turn-in” card; so, also, is discount
given on goods sold in quantity, as a box of cigars, for example.</p>

<p>Since the whole operation of accounting for our goods on the basis of
selling price is purely for the purpose of protecting our stock, and not for
the purpose of calculating our monthly profit and loss sheets, it is seen
that it is necessary to make out another copy of Form 17 daily, in order to
record the same transfers, issues, etc., on a <em>cost</em> price basis. This will be
discussed more fully later, but let it be stated here that this work is necessitated
by the rule which requires us to base our statement of assets, insofar
as merchandise is concerned, upon the cost price of same. This, for
the reason that it is not sound practice to anticipate profits. Therefore,
our inventories, <em>when carried as assets</em>, must be based on cost prices, and
in order to secure a true statement of profits earned, we must record the
cost price of all merchandise that has been purchased during the month
and distribute this cost properly among the departments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of each day’s work, the stock clerk signs his Form 17 for
that day and fastens to it all invoices, retained copies of orders (accomplished
as previously described) and requisitions that are entered on said
Form 17. These papers are really vouchers to this report and should remain
with it until they have been checked against it. The whole bunch of
papers is handed in to the Steward and Form 17 is checked as soon as
possible. After this is completed, the invoices and the retained copies of
our original orders which pertain to them are handled as described under
Purchase Records; their function as a part of the system of stock records
having ceased.</p>

<h3>Consolidating Stock Transactions.</h3>

<p>The stock record is composed of two parts—one relating to <em>cost</em> prices
and the other to <em>selling</em> prices. In all other respects, these two parts are
identical and are handled in the same way. Each “selling” Form 17 is
entered on a single line of the “selling” stock record, and each “cost” Form
17 is abstracted to a single line of the “cost” stock record. One page of the
stock record (Form 27) is shown in Fig. 22. Only the left hand page is
shown; the other departments are supposed to be on a right hand page,
confronting the one shown in the cut. In cases of departments where
credit transfers do not exist, the CR column can be omitted, with a resulting
saving in space.</p>

<h3>Checking Stock and Sales.</h3>

<p>At the end of the month, or whenever our books are closed, we total
each column on the adding machine and enter these totals on the next
blank line, as shown, and then, when our inventory is taken, the value
thereof at selling price is computed and entered just below these totals in
the appropriate columns, and subtracted from them. The remainders, it is
evident, should equal the total sales for the period considered. In order
to compare these amounts, we now enter the total sales for each department
in its proper column and find the difference between these figures
and those immediately over them, and enter the discrepancies at the foot
of the columns. These operations are shown in the figure. Theoretically,
the amounts in the CR columns should just balance the discrepancies in
the DR columns, but in actual practice, this state of affairs will rarely
occur. The resulting net discrepancies, if small, are due, primarily, to
wastage, failure to sell exact weights, etc. If these discrepancies are large,
the cause thereof should be promptly investigated.</p>

<p>It is easily seen that this scheme permits us to make a check on any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
department at any time
by simply taking an inventory
of that department.
All other data
that we need for such a
check are already available,
and, as it would
not take long to take an
inventory of a single department,
these checks
should afford us a most
efficient means of keeping
track of our departments.
It should be unnecessary
to state that
these check inventories
should be taken without
warning, and, preferably,
by the Exchange officer
himself.</p>

<p>If this system of handling
stock is faithfully
carried out, one of the
greatest chances for
“leakage” in the Post
Exchange will be absolutely
prohibited. It requires
work, but no more
so than any other efficient
stock record, and
the results are superior
to those obtained from
any other system known
to the writer. If any exchange
employee objects
to the system on the
ground that it entails too
much work, it might be
safely assumed that his
real objection lies in the
system’s efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="PURCHASE_RECORDS">PURCHASE RECORDS.</h2>

<p>In most Exchanges, the custom obtains of keeping in the ledger a
separate account for each creditor, i. e., each person or firm from whom
goods are purchased. This entails an enormous amount of work, and as
this work can be done by none but an efficient employee, it also entails a
considerable unnecessary expense. In the system to be described, this
work is reduced to a minimum, and while each of our creditors has his
ledger account, this account is kept in such form as to require no duplication
of our records, and, at the same time, to tell us at any time exactly
how we stand with each of our creditors.</p>

<h3>Purchase Orders.</h3>

<p>Let us start with the process of ordering our merchandise. This is
done on Form 15, shown in Fig. 23. By means of carbon paper, a duplicate
of our order is entered on Form 28, shown in Fig. 24. The original
goes to our creditor as an order; these orders are numbered consecutively
throughout the year, or even over a longer space of time, should it be
found desirable. Form 28 goes to the Receiving Clerk and is held by him
on a Shannon file until the goods arrive. He then checks the goods
against this form and issues them as described under “Stock Records”. A
variation of this method, known as the “blind tally”, is worked by making
out a triplicate copy on Form 28, this copy to have the “quantity” column
blank, which is easily effected by slipping a piece of paper above it to
receive the carbon record which would otherwise be printed in that column.
The receiving clerk then has no idea of the quantities ordered and fills in
the “quantity” column himself. A comparison of this with the duplicate
(kept locked up in the office) quickly shows us whether we received all of
our goods. This system has broken up some very obscure practices. In
either system, it should be noted that we need not await the arrival of the
invoice, unless it is desired to do so, before issuing goods to departments.
The columns at the right of Form 28 are for convenience in calculating
selling prices, etc.</p>

<img src="images/figure24.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 24</p>
</div>

<p>As previously noted, the receiving clerk (or stock clerk, whoever
handles this work) hands in at the close of business each day, two copies
of Form 17, one covering the selling price of all stock which has arrived
or been transferred during the day, and the other covering the cost price of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
same. Attached to these forms are all requisitions and receiving records
(Form 28) covered by these Forms 17. The Steward sees that each receiving
record is correctly calculated and properly entered on <em>both</em> copies
of Form 17. (He, also, at this time, sees that the requisitions are properly
entered on both forms.) The receiving records are then filed in a Shannon
drawer to await the arrival of invoices or for comparison with them
if they have already arrived. For convenience, they are filed behind
alphabetical guides according to the names of our creditors. When the
invoices arrive, they are filed in the same manner and in the same drawer.
They would, therefore, naturally tend to find each other.</p>

<p>Before the receiving record is sent from the office to the receiving
clerk in the first place, the order is entered in our Purchase Record, which,
as its name indicates, is a chronological record of all our purchases of
merchandise of whatever sort. Hire of services, of course, is not entered
in this record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/figure25.jpg" width="700" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 25, (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p>There are various
forms in use for Purchase
Records, invoice
Records, etc., and a
study of several of them
leads us to advocate the
use of Form 29, shown
in Fig. 25 as being the
best suited to the work
in hand. This is specially
ruled and printed
and like most of the
other forms described is
as well suited to the
needs of a small exchange
as a large one.
They will cost about
$12.00 per thousand and
a good substantial binder
for them will cost from
$2.75 to $11.00, depending
upon the quality of
the binding. One and a
quarter inch back is
large enough for our
purpose; the sheets are
10¼ × 10½ inches, the
former being the binding
side.</p>

<p>When our order is
first made out, we enter
in the proper column of
the purchase record, the
name of the firm on
whom the order is
drawn. This is the only
entry made at this time,
and the retained copy of
the order (the receiving
record) is then sent to
the receiving clerk.
When the invoices arrive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
they are stamped as shown in
Fig. 26, the 1st and 2d lines of this
stamp are filled in, their date is entered
in the left hand columns of the
purchase record and the invoices are
then filed as before described. In
this way, the office keeps track of how
fast the stock is arriving, because the
number of firm names entered on the
purchase record will show us the
number of outstanding orders, and
the number of dated entries will show
us the number of invoices that have arrived which have not yet
been checked up by the Steward (usually because the goods have not
arrived). When the goods arrive, whether they follow or precede their
invoices, and the receiving clerk has checked them into stock and returned
Form 28 to the office, the purchase price is entered in the Purchase-Credit
column shown. This purchase price disregards our cash discount, which
is cared for in the cash book. However, if there is any allowance due us
for returning all or a part of the goods on any invoice, the amount of such
rebate is entered in the Debit-Purchase column. This is the only use to
which this column is put.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/figure26.jpg" width="500" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 26</p>
</div>

<p>Let us suppose that we are now ready to pay a bunch of invoices.
Proceed as follows:—</p>

<p>1. Take the invoice file, and, starting with the letter “A”, go through
the file, taking the accomplished invoices as you come to them. All those
relating to any one firm should be found together, as before mentioned,
thus saving much time at this stage.</p>

<p>2. Having your invoices, make out a voucher (Form 14, Fig. 27)
for each firm or creditor concerned, entering thereon all invoices relating
to that firm. If the buying is done properly, there should be plenty of
room on the voucher for these invoices. (In case of a firm from whom
we make almost daily purchases, we hold the invoices and make one payment
at the end of the month.)</p>

<p>3. As you go along, have a dating stamp handy and stamp the date
on each invoice as you make out the corresponding voucher. If the invoice
is discounted, stamp the date in the “Discounted” space; if there is
no discount, stamp the date opposite the word PAID (see Fig. 26). At
the same time, enter the voucher number (which may, and probably will
differ from the invoice number) in blue pencil on the proper space of
this same stamped impression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/figure27.jpg" width="700" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 27, (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>4. When all the invoices are finished, take the vouchers, and, starting
with the top one, find where each invoice is entered in the purchase record
and stamp the date in the PAID column opposite each entry. These places
are easily found by reading the invoice numbers entered on the vouchers.</p>

<p>5. While you are stamping these dates, <em>compare, as you go along, the
amount of the invoices as entered on the vouchers, with the amounts entered
in the purchase record</em>.</p>

<p>6. Now take the vouchers and enter them in the Cash Book on the
right or credit side. In the “net cash” and “creditors” columns should be
entered the exact amounts actually paid, in the Discount column should be
entered the amount of discount allowed. Discount is always shown in
the cash book and on the vouchers in red ink, to avoid confusion with
credits, which should be shown in black.</p>

<p>7. After the cash book has been posted, the proper checks are made
out, ready for the signature of the Exchange Officer. They and the
vouchers are then mailed to the various creditors.</p>

<p>8. The paid invoices are then placed in a Shannon file drawer by
themselves where they can be consulted easily. They form a complete file
of sub-vouchers to the cash account for the month. They should never be
mailed to our creditors for the purpose of having them receipted; it takes
too much energy and time to get them back. In case our creditor fails
to return our voucher, we can still prove payment, beyond a <em>reasonable</em>
doubt, by producing the canceled check (which he must release sooner or
later) and the original invoice exactly corresponding to it in value. One
authority goes so far as to say,—“If a check bears no evidence as to its
purpose but can readily be identified with a particular bill or invoice, it
still is a better voucher than a receipted bill, ... a mere receipt
for so much money, which can readily be forged, is poor evidence of
a legitimate payment, but a paid check, properly endorsed and otherwise
identified as representing a definite liability, is pretty fair proof that the
money has reached the creditors.” (P. 49, Vol. 6, Enc. Commerce and Accounting.)</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, we sometimes experience considerable difficulty
in getting even the vouchers back from our creditors. Lieut. Schudt, at
the Fort Levett Exchange, hit upon a scheme which tends to lessen this
difficulty. This is, simply to have the vouchers printed on a card of suitable
weight; the reverse of each card being printed in the form of a self-addressed
penalty post card. Our creditor, after dating and receipting
the voucher, simply drops it into the mail box without the additional
trouble of mailing it in an envelope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Voucher Check System.</h3>

<p>A much more efficient system than that just described, one which we
hope will some day be prescribed by regulations, is the “voucher check”
system. This system is rapidly forcing its way to the front through the
merits of its sheer efficiency, and is now in force in the business administration
of many large concerns, the Pennsylvania Railroad, for example.
The system is founded on the indisputable proof of payment that is afforded
by an endorsed and paid check. As one eminent authority on
auditing, has said,—“If a check bears on its face or back any indication
of its purpose, it is the best receipt for money paid that can be secured”.</p>

<p>The voucher check system does away with separate “vouchers”, as we
in the Army are accustomed to think of them; the checks themselves are
our vouchers. The checks are somewhat different from the usual type, as
they bear on their face a statement of the invoices they pay. In fact, they
contain substantially the same matter as is shown on our regular voucher.
Form 30, Fig. 28, shows a voucher check that would be entirely suited to
our use. It may be unnecessary to explain, the dates, numbers and amounts
of the invoices are entered at the right in the proper spaces, the amounts
are totaled, rebates, allowances, etc., are deducted, the discount applied to
the remainder and the check proper (left hand part) made out accordingly.
Form 30a, shown in the same figure, is the carbon copy, the original being
made out in indelible pencil. The right hand or coupon part of this duplicate
is torn off, pinned to and mailed with the original check. It gives our
creditor a memo of the payment, rendering it unnecessary for him to hold
the check until he can make a special note of the payment, thus helping him
out and at the same time expediting the process of cashing in our check.
The left hand part of Form 30a remains in the check book and performs
the same function as the regulation check stub. It will be noted that we
thus save the labor usually expended in filling out our stubs and in addition,
we are not liable to accidentally forget to fill out the stubs altogether,
as sometimes happens with the regular style of check book.</p>

<p>The form and size of these voucher checks lend themselves very readily
to manufacture in the same “make-up” as certain kinds of sales books,
but the ordinary style of duplicating book is probably just as good as the
more elaborate kinds. The checks should be printed three to the page and
care should be taken that the duplicate forms are “in register” with the
originals, otherwise, the carbon copy data will not appear opposite the
proper notations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/figure28.jpg" width="700" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 28, (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p>When these voucher checks are returned to us by our banker, we file
them in a check filing drawer, equipped with sets of monthly tabbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
guides, according to the voucher numbers, thus forming the voucher record
for our cash disbursements.</p>

<p>It is hard to find a weak spot in the check voucher system, but some
inspectors seem to object to it, so, until it is specifically authorized by the
War Department, the inexperienced Exchange Officer would do well to
stick to the system previously described.</p>

<p>To revert to our purchase record sheets: there is no necessity for
noting thereon the amount paid on each invoice or the discount on same,
as is sometimes done. This information will be shown in the cash book,
and data should not be repeated unnecessarily. The remaining two columns
(Balances) are used only when closing the books. Whenever this
is done, the balance on each order is brought out to the proper column, the
amount we owe being entered in the credit side of this column, and the
amount due us being entered on the debit side. The total of the credit
side of the Purchase column is then posted as a lump sum to the credit
side of the “Bills Payable Merchandise” account on the general ledger,
and the total of the debit side is posted to the debit side of the same account.
Ordinarily, there will be no such debit entries. It will be seen that
the net balance of the Purchase Record and of the above account should
equal the difference between the total purchases and the sum of the totals
shown in the “Creditors” and the “Discounts” columns in the cash book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h3>CASH DISBURSEMENTS.</h3>

<p>The right or credit side of the cash book is, in general, of the same
form as the debit side. See Fig. 11. As all distribution of merchandise to
the various departments is made through the stock records, there is no
necessity of trying to duplicate this information on the pages of the cash
book. We, therefore, lump all merchandise payments under the heading
“Creditors” and reserve a column for such payments only. In a similar
manner, all payments for services rendered in the various departments
could be entered under a heading, “Labor”, and the proper distribution or
pro-rata share of each department could be shown on the receipted pay
roll, as explained hereafter.</p>

<p>Other columns that will be needed are:—Maintenance, Fixtures, Interest
and Discount, Appropriations, and Expense. All disbursements
which can not be placed in one of the other columns should be entered
under Interest and Discount. Under Appropriations, enter all disbursements
voted by the Exchange Council for Athletics, Dividends, Sick in
Hospital, etc. Under Fixtures should go all expenditures for permanent
equipment (new) of the Exchange, and under Maintenance, all money
spent for repairs, replacing of old equipment by new, and the like. In the
Expense Column we carry such items as wastage, breakage, telephone and
telegraph bills, fuel, light, insurance, printing and stationery, and such
expendable supplies as twine, paper, etc., as are used in carrying on the
business. When the Exchange Officer or authorized agent makes a purchasing
trip on purely Exchange business, his authorized expenses should
be entered in this column. Exchange Councils differ in their interpretations
of what such expenses should be, and the Exchange Officer should
have it recorded in the proceedings of the Council that such allowances of
expenses are authorized.</p>

<p>To sum up:—the columns of the credit side of the cash book, reading
from left to right are as follows:—Date; Description of item entered,
giving name of creditor and a clue to the articles on the invoices; Voucher
No.; Check No.; Net Cash; Discount; Creditors (or Merchandise);
Labor; Appropriations; Fixtures; Interest and Discount; Expense; Sundries,
and perhaps, one or two spare columns.</p>

<p>At the end of the month or when the books are closed, the totals of
the various columns are posted to the debit side of the General Ledger as
follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Creditors posted to Bills Payable, Mdse.</p>

<p>Interest and Discount to Interest and Discount.</p>

<p>Discount to Interest and Discount.</p>

<p>Fixtures to Fixtures (Exchange or Laundry, as the case may be).</p>

<p>The items entered in the Expense column must be distributed, such
items as cannot properly be posted to the account of any of the departments
must be posted to the “General Expense” account in the General
Ledger. The same rule applies to Labor and to Sundries. The items in
the Appropriations column must also be distributed among the proper
ledger accounts, such as Athletics, Dividends, Sick in Hospital, etc., as the
case may be.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="THE_LEDGER">THE LEDGER.</h2>

<h3>General.</h3>

<p>The ledger is the book which shows us the status of every part of our
business. It is the most important book that we keep, and, consequently, it
should be kept with great care. Every transaction, no matter how small,
sooner or later finds its way to the ledger, although it will not be given the
dignity of a line to itself. The ledger is, of course, kept on the double
entry system.</p>

<h3>Make-up.</h3>

<p>There are several stock forms for ledger sheets, that shown as Form
30, in Fig. 30, being one of the best, as the center balance column saves
much space. Perhaps the most convenient size is 11¼ × 11⅞ inches, which
gives about the right amount of room in all columns. These sheets,
printed and ruled as shown, cost $12.00 per thousand, retail. Leather
tabbed indices cost $1.65 per set and a high grade ledger binder costs $12.00,
although a cheaper type, known as a “transfer” can be obtained for a price
as low as $2.75, but it would not give the service and satisfaction of the
regular type of ledger. In our system, a ledger with a 1¼ inch back
should prove of ample size.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/figure30.jpg" width="700" height="175" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 30, (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Live accounts only should be kept in the ledger; as soon as an account
has been closed out, the pages containing same should be taken out and
placed in a ledger transfer binder. The same procedure should be followed
with the filled pages of live accounts just as soon as there becomes
little chance of their being consulted frequently.</p>

<h3>Ledger Accounts.</h3>

<p>As has been previously described, our method of handling our charge
accounts has rendered it unnecessary for us to keep a private ledger account
with each of our charge customers. To do so would be merely to
repeat information which we already possess. Also, our Purchase Record
has obviated the necessity of a separate ledger account with each of our
creditors, for the same reason.</p>

<p>Having no <em>private</em> ledger accounts, it follows that this book then
becomes a “General Ledger”, holding only general accounts, such as Bills
Payable, etc.</p>

<p>Some of our general accounts should be sub-divided in order to give
us a better idea of what the business is doing. Take the Expense account,
for example. It is usually desirable to classify our expenses as nearly as
possible under the following headings:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Wages,</li>
<li>Fuel and Lights,</li>
<li>Insurance,</li>
<li>Freight and Express on out-going goods,</li>
<li>Printing and Stationery,</li>
<li>Telephone and Telegraph,</li>
<li>Office, including expendable supplies used and not distributed to departments.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another example is Bills Payable, which is divided into Charge Accounts,
Credit Coupons, Enlisted Men’s Laundry, etc., as circumstances dictate.</p>

<p>A complete list of the accounts in our ledger should run about as
follows:—</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Post Exchange (Synonyms:—Present Worth, Surplus, Net Worth, etc.).</li>
<li>2. Bills Receivable, Notes. (Entrance fees of incoming organizations.)</li>
<li>3. Bills Receivable, Charge Accounts.</li>
<li>4. Bills Receivable, Credit Coupons.</li>

<h3>Posting the Ledger.</h3>

<p>It has been noticed that our Ledger is used but once a month or whenever
our books are closed. At this time, each account in the ledger is
brought down to date by entering the results obtained by summarizing the
accounts contained in the subsidiary books. This operation is called
“posting” and will be discussed with reference to each of the foregoing
accounts. It will be assumed, in each case, that the balance from the
previous month has been brought down correctly.</p>

<p>It will be of great assistance to remember that any account in the
General Ledger represents <em>one</em> of the following:—</p>

<ul>
<li>1. An asset; (Resource).</li>
<li>2. A liability.</li>
<li>3. A Loss.</li>
<li>4. A Profit or Gain.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>a.</i> Every account showing a debit balance is either an asset or a loss;
a “Personal” account showing a debit balance is an asset, an “expense”
account showing a debit balance is a loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p><i>b.</i> Every account showing a credit balance is either a liability or a
profit; a “personal” account showing a credit balance is a liability (something
we owe), any sales account showing a credit balance is a profit.</p>

<p>1. <i>Post Exchange Account.</i> Another name for this account is “Net
Worth”, or, if the Exchange is out of debt, “Surplus”. It is important
that the status of this account be shown on every monthly statement exhibited
to the Exchange Council. It is debited at the beginning of the
month with the net worth of the Exchange on that date. Credit it with
such decreases and debit it with such increases as will be shown on the
“Surplus and Adjustment Schedule” on Form 32 and discussed in connection
therewith.</p>

<p>2. <i>Bills Receivable, Notes.</i> Debit this account for the amount owed
by any organization to the Exchange for Entrance fees, etc., and credit it
via the cash book with the amount of payments received from such
organizations.</p>

<p>3. <i>Bills Receivable, Charge Accounts.</i> Debit this account, as before
described, with the total amount of charge sales made during the month,
which amount is obtained from the Charge Accounts book. Credit this
account with the total of the “Customers” column on the debit side of the
cash book and also with the total of the “Credit” column in the Charge
Accounts book.</p>

<p>4. <i>Bills Receivable, Credit Coupons.</i> This account has been exhaustively
discussed under “Coupons”.</p>

<p>5. <i>Bills Receivable, Enlisted Men’s Laundry.</i> Debit this account at
the end of the month with the gross amount of laundry bills contracted by
enlisted men during the month. Credit it with the total of the cash book
(debit) column in which are entered the payments by enlisted men for
laundry work done. Also credit this account with whatever credits have
been allowed for overcharges, damages, etc., these amounts also being
charged (debited) against the Laundry account.</p>

<p>6. <i>Check Account.</i> See note under paragraph 4 above.</p>

<p>7. <i>Bills Payable, Merchandise.</i> Debit this account with balance due
creditors on 1st of the month and with Cr. Purchase column of Purchase
Record. Credit it with amount of creditors column in cash book, and
with total of Dr. Purchase column of Purchase Record.</p>

<p>8. <i>Exchange Building.</i> If built and owned by the Government, this
item is not an asset of the Exchange. If the building belongs to the Exchange,
we debit this account with all amounts spent upon it for additions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of any kind, but not for repairs, renewals, painting, etc. Credit this account
with all depreciation voted by the Post Exchange Council, and debit
this amount against the Depreciation Account.</p>

<p>9. <i>Laundry Building.</i> Same as preceding.</p>

<p>10. <i>Exchange Fixtures.</i> Debit this account through the cash book
with the amount of all new fixtures purchased; credit it with the amount
of depreciation voted by the Exchange Council, as before explained, also,
with the book value of all fixtures scrapped or otherwise disposed of.
When an article is merely replaced by a newly purchased one, it is proper
to make no change in the value of our fixtures, but charge the whole
purchase price against maintenance. The same applies to cost of repairs.</p>

<p>11. <i>Laundry Fixtures.</i> Same as preceding.</p>

<p>12. <i>Laundry.</i> This is a live account against which are charged
(debited):—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The total of the Debit Laundry column in the Cost Price
Stock Record, (Form 13), also, the value of inventory at 1st
of month.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The total cost of labor incurred by that department.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Any CASH REIMBURSEMENTS that may have been
paid to customers.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Such items of Freight, Expense, Maintenance, Board, etc.,
as may have been paid during the month on account of the
Laundry.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Any credits that may be allowed for damages, etc. (From
Charge Accts.)</p>

</div>

<p>This account is credited with:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The total of the Laundry columns in the Charge Accounts
Book.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The total of the Laundry columns pertaining to the current
month on our paytable collection sheets (Form 25).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The total shown in the Credit Laundry column of Form 13</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The total of all sales not accounted for under (a) and (b)
above.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Inventory at last of month.</p>

</div>

<p>The balance, showing gross loss or gain, is transferred to the Profit and
Loss Account.</p>

<p>13. <i>Store.</i> This and all other departmental accounts should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
handled in the manner described in the preceding paragraph except they
should receive credit for all coupon and cash sales made during the month.</p>

<p>14. <i>Interest and Discount.</i> Credit this account with the total of the
Discount column on the credit side of the cash book; this anomaly being
only apparent, not real. Credit, also, the total of the Interest and Discount
column on the debit side of the cash book and debit the total of the Interest
and Discount column found on the credit side of the cash book.</p>

<p>15. <i>Insurance.</i> Debit this account, through the cash book, with all
premiums paid out, at the time they are paid. Credit this account monthly
with the monthly share of such premium or premiums, and debit them
against Post Exchange. The effect of this method is to show the unexpired
policies as assets, as they should be. There can be no doubt that an unexpired
policy is an asset, nor is there any question about the propriety of
showing the value of this asset by deducting the appropriate amount
monthly. The practice of some exchanges of writing such assets off the
books immediately upon payment of premiums is not sound.</p>

<p>16. <i>Fuel and Lights.</i> Debit this account through the cash book with
all amounts paid out for these items, provided they cannot be properly
apportioned to the various departments.</p>

<p>17. <i>Freight and Express.</i> Same as preceding, except that all such
charges on incoming merchandise should be charged to the goods in question,
just as if they cost us that much more. “Out” freight, etc., is a
legitimate charge against this account.</p>

<p>18. <i>Printing and Stationery.</i> Same remarks as under 16.</p>

<p>19. <i>Telephone and Telegraph.</i> Same as under 16.</p>

<p>20. <i>General Expense.</i> Debit this account with all items of expense
that cannot properly be placed under one of the other expense accounts.</p>

<p>21. <i>Depreciation.</i> Debit this account with the total amount of depreciation
voted by the Council, and as this entails a corresponding credit
elsewhere in the ledger, the respective accounts affected must be credited to
a corresponding amount. When the books are closed, the balance of this
account is transferred to Profit and Loss by crediting Depreciation and
debiting the latter account. This Depreciation account can be eliminated
entirely, if desired, by crediting Exchange Fixtures or what not with the
amount of depreciation decreed by the Council and debiting this amount
straight against Post Exchange. This is the usual method.</p>

<p>22. <i>Lost Accounts.</i> Debit this account with all bad debts which we
have decided we cannot collect. This, of course, necessitates a corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
credit entry in some other account, such as Bills Receivable Credit
Coupons or Charge Accounts, etc., as the case may be. When the books
are closed, this account is balanced and transferred to Profit and Loss, as
explained in 21. If any of these accounts are afterwards collected, we
must credit this account, via the cash book, with the proper amounts.</p>

<p>23. <i>Athletics.</i> Credit this account with all amounts voted by the Exchange
Council for the support of athletics and charge or debit the same
amount against Post Exchange (Account No. 1, above). At the end of
each month, pick out of the Appropriations column on the credit side of
the cash book, all amounts which were spent for athletics during the month
and debit them to this account. The credit balance of this account is a
liability against the Exchange.</p>

<p>24. <i>Dividends.</i> Credit this account with the amount of dividends declared
by the Council and debit the same amount against Post Exchange
account. Debit this account with all dividends paid to organizations. If
the dividends have not been paid out by the end of the month, they will
show up in this account as a credit balance, a liability against the Exchange;
if they have been paid, there will be no balance left to this
account.</p>

<p>25. <i>Sick in Hospital.</i> Same as preceding.</p>

<p>26. <i>Regimental Fund.</i> Same as 24.</p>

<p>27. <i>Wages.</i> It will be remembered that each department was debited
with its share of all labor charges incurred during the month. These “accrued
wages” are credited to this account in the Ledger. Debit this account
with the total of the Labor column on the credit side of the cash
book. Any credit balance remaining (as when part of the pay due an
employee is held back) is a liability against the Exchange.</p>

<p>28. <i>Profit and Loss.</i> This account is ordinarily posted only upon
closing the books. To this account, we post the balances of all those
Ledger accounts which show a profit or a loss to the Exchange. These
include all departmental accounts and also accounts numbered 14 to 29,
inclusive, except Nos. 15, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26 and No. 28, which is now under
discussion. Remember that each of these accounts which shows a debit
balance is a loss and each that shows a credit balance is a profit or gain.
After all of these accounts have been balanced and brought into Profit and
Loss, the latter is balanced and the balance transferred to Post Exchange.
Before this last named operation is performed, however, a trial balance
should be taken, because, for reasons before explained, the books will never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
balance to the cent, and the entry of a small item, usually “income not
otherwise accounted for,” is necessary in this account before the books will
balance.</p>

<p>29. <i>Maintenance.</i> This is really in the nature of an expense account
and we should debit it with the amounts shown on the credit side of the
cash book as paid out on this account. Credit this account for such items
as can be and are debited against any of the departments (see 12 d);
credit this account for the balance remaining at the end of the month and
charge same against Profit and Loss.</p>

<h3>Balancing the Ledger.</h3>

<p>It has been stated above, that all “Expense” accounts are balanced
monthly and posted to Profit and Loss, and that after a trial balance has
proved the Ledger to be in balance, the balance of the Profit and Loss
account is transferred to the “Post Exchange” account. The remaining
accounts, Nos. 1-11, inclusive, etc., represent assets and liabilities and are
not transferred at all, although they are balanced every month.</p>

<p>We now come to the book-keepers’ bug-a-boo, the “Trial Balance”.
This is a simple thing (to describe), consisting merely going through our
ledger, taking the total of all the totals on the credit side of all our ledger
accounts and seeing if this equals the total of all the totals on the debit
side. If these totals do not agree, the book-keeper must run down the
error and correct it. There are no rules for this procedure that would be
of practical benefit. This trial balance does not necessarily mean that the
ledger is correct, it simply proves that for every debit item entered a corresponding
credit entry has been made; it does not prove that these entries
have been made in the proper accounts.</p>

<p>A sample trial balance sheet, worked out by Mr. Parker, cashier of the
Fort Slocum Exchange, is shown herewith.</p>

<p>After the ledger is balanced, we proceed to get out our monthly statement.
If it is a case of an inspector, we can get all the data he needs by
simply taking our statements since his last visit and combining the results
shown by same.</p>

<h2 id="MONTHLY_STATEMENTS">MONTHLY STATEMENTS.</h2>

<h3>General.</h3>

<p>The primary object of the monthly statement is to give the Exchange
Council and the Commanding Officer a clear and concise understanding of
the operations and financial standing of the Exchange. The statement,
therefore, should be so simple in construction that it can be understood at
a glance by anybody, regardless of their knowledge of book-keeping. Most
statements submitted to Exchange Councils either show nothing or lead
to a waste of time, due to the necessity for asking for explanations of
obscure items. The statement should also contain such information as
will be required by the Inspector. The form of statement here shown
fulfils all of the above requirements and is a form approved by certified
public accountants. It is divided into three parts, which will be discussed
in their relative order.</p>

<h3>General Balance Sheet.</h3>

<p>This, Form 32, is shown in Fig. 31 and is almost self explanatory. Attention
is invited to the scheme of segregating different classes of assets
and of liabilities. A stock form of this nature would do for all Exchanges,
regardless of their size, as there are sufficient blank lines to suit all requirements,
but perhaps better satisfaction would be obtained if the form
here shown be merely taken as a model and only those items be used as
apply to the particular case in hand. Pains have been taken, in this form,
to insert a sufficient number of entries to show clearly how any ordinary
item should be handled.</p>

<p>Of course, the item, “Exchange building”, should be omitted if the
building belongs to the Government and not to the Exchange. The item,
“Cash Reserve”, covers the amount required by regulations to be set aside
before dividends can be declared. Under the liabilities, there will ordinarily
be no entries under “Funded Debt”; this entry merely shows how such
items should be handled in case any should exist. “Commissions due” is
the amount we owe for goods already sold on consignment; the same item
under the assets refers to the amount due us for goods sold on consignment
or commission. A declared dividend is a liability until it is paid. Outstanding
coupons are also a liability. Under the deferred liabilities come
any amounts that are payable at some future date, but are meanwhile bona
fide debts owed by the Exchange. The term “Total Surplus” refers to the
surplus at the end of the month in question, and, while not really a
liability, it is put in this place in order to properly balance the account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/figure31.jpg" width="500" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 31, (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<h3>Surplus and Adjustments.</h3>

<p>Under this head, we show the changes in the net worth of the Exchange
which have occurred during the month, this being, to all intents
and purposes, a repetition of the Post Exchange Account in our general
Ledger.</p>

<p>Under “Re-valuation”, take up any increase in the value of buildings or
fixtures that may have occurred other than through the cash book (upon
appraisal, for instance). Under “Adjustment”, take up any increase of
amount owed us on any account, that is, if any account has been corrected
during the month and the amount due us on this account has been increased,
the amount of such increase should be taken up under the head in
question. The net profits for the month are obtained from the Statement
of Income and Profit and Loss, to be described later. All of the above
items serve to increase our surplus or net worth, and hence, must be added
to the net worth shown at the beginning of the month.</p>

<p>Under the deductions would come all amounts written off for depreciation;
dividends actually paid; appropriations paid or put to the credit of
any particular fund, such as the Athletic Fund; and all decreases in
accounts owed us, caused by the adjustment of same.</p>

<p>After the above notations are made, the surplus at the end of the
month is entered in the proper space in the general balance sheet. This
surplus is the net worth of the Post Exchange, and should, of course, be
equal to the balance of the Post Exchange account in the Ledger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<h3>Statement of Income and Profit and Loss.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption">Figure 32, (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p>This, Form 16, gives us a very clear and concise statement of the
operations of all of our departments during the month. It is printed on
the back of Form 32. It is filled in as follows:—</p>

<p><i>a</i> Enter on the first line, the total sales for cash as shown by the footings
of the respective debit columns in the cash book.</p>

<p><i>b</i> On the second line, enter the total coupon sales of the various departments
shown by the footings of the respective columns of Form 26
(Fig. 17).</p>

<p><i>c</i> On the third line, enter the total charge sales made by each department
as shown by the footings of the respective columns of Form 7
(Fig. 6).</p>

<p><i>d</i> Add the above, both horizontally and vertically and see if the grand
totals check.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p><i>e</i> Enter on the fourth line all credits given during the month.</p>

<p><i>f</i> Subtract <i>e</i> from <i>d</i>; the remainder shows the net sales made by each
department during the month and should be entered in the proper spaces.</p>

<p><i>g</i> Under “Inventory ... 1st”, is entered the cost price of all merchandise
on hand in the various departments at the beginning of the month,
which amounts are obtained from the Inventory Book or Inventory cards
as before described.</p>

<p><i>h</i> Under “Purchases” are entered the cost values of all merchandise
sent to the various departments, that is, the difference between the footings
of the Dr. and Cr. columns referring to each department on Form 13 (Cost
Price). No cash discount is considered.</p>

<p><i>i</i> Under “Labor”, charge each department with its proper share of the
wages paid by the Exchange. If any employee divides his time between
two or more departments, his wages should be distributed between said
departments proportionately. Book-keeper’s wages should be charged to
Office. To counterbalance this charge, some Exchanges credit all cash
discounts to Office instead of taking them up under Other Income. This is
entirely proper, as is also the procedure of crediting the Office with mail
order profits, etc. In the usual case, there being no accrued wages, the
figures for labor are taken from the Labor column in the cash book.</p>

<p><i>j</i> Under “Maintenance”, transfer from the cash book all amounts paid
out for</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) Articles bought to replace other similar articles worn out.</li>
<li>(2) Paints, cleaning material or repairs and spare parts, etc.</li>
<li>(3) Labor charges in connection with the foregoing.</li>
<li>(4) In general, any expenditure for up-keep.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>k</i> Under “Board”, should be entered all amounts paid out for board of
employees.</p>

<p><i>l</i> Under “Expense”, enter the value of all expendable supplies issued
to the various departments, such as paper bags, etc., or, as illustrated in the
case of a Laundry, the cost of all soaps, starch, soda, etc.</p>

<p><i>m</i> Add items (<i>g</i>) to (<i>l</i>), inclusive, and enter the totals on the proper
line. Also, add the items horizontally and check the grand totals obtained
by these two operations.</p>

<p><i>n</i> Enter under “Deduct Inventory”, the cost price of all articles found
on hand in the various departments at the end of the month.</p>

<p><i>o</i> Subtract (<i>n</i>) from (<i>m</i>) and enter the respective remainders in the
spaces for “Cost of Goods Sold”. Check these remainders vertically and
horizontally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p><i>p</i> Subtract the Cost of Goods Sold from Net Sales and enter the remainders
in the spaces for “Gross Profit”. Check results as before.</p>

<p>The lower part of this form is made out as follows:—</p>

<p><i>a</i> Under “Cash Discounts” (unless credited to Office as before explained),
enter the total of the Discounts column in the cash book.</p>

<p><i>b</i> Cash in excess of daily checks is self explanatory.</p>

<p><i>c</i> Under “Goods Sold on Consignment”, should be entered all such
sales actually made during the month.</p>

<p><i>d</i> Miscellaneous credits is self explanatory, being for such items as
junk, receptacles sold, etc., as are not credited through the stock records.</p>

<p><i>e</i> Entrance fees cover all payments by organizations joining the Exchange.</p>

<p><i>f</i> Interest on Bank balances is self explanatory.</p>

<p><i>g</i> Lost Accounts collected refers to amounts that have previously been
dropped from the books as lost, but have afterwards been collected.</p>

<p><i>h</i> Under “Income not otherwise accounted for”, is entered the amount
that will make the books balance. As it is impracticable to give precise
weights on bulk merchandise and as mistakes will sometimes occur, the
books will never balance exactly and all discrepancies are thrown into this
item. As an example, suppose we unintentionally give short weights on
our sales of, say, crackers. At the end of the month, we will have more
money on hand than our sales would call for, and such excess is taken up
under this heading. If, as sometimes happens, there is a deficit (for example,
caused by melting and wastage of ice) it should be taken up under
the “General Expense” side of this form. It should be noted that this
item cannot be filled in until the General Balance Sheet is made out.</p>

<p><i>i</i> “Freight and Express Out” refers to transportation charges on
goods returned to our creditors or sold to our customers.</p>

<p><i>j</i> Under the item, “Insurance”, should be entered the total premiums
paid out during the month, but not the pro-rata share that is charged off
monthly.</p>

<p><i>k</i> Under “Paid on Consignment”, should be entered the net amounts
paid to our creditors for the goods sold by us.</p>

<p><i>l</i> To the Total Gross Profit, add the total Other Income, from this
amount, subtract the Total General Expense and the remainder is the net
profit for the month; it should be carried to the Surplus and Adjustment
part of the general balance sheet.</p>

<h2 id="PAY_ROLLS">PAY ROLLS.</h2>

<p class="caption">Figure 33, (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p>A thoroughly satisfactory form for pay rolls is shown by Form 2 in
Fig. 33. The Recapitulation at the bottom of the form is for the purpose
of distributing the cost of labor among the various departments when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
make out our statement of income and profit and loss. If employees are
not paid up to date, that is, if a part of their pay due is withheld, this form
allows such information to be recorded. In some cases, it has been found
practicable to pay off three times a month, especially in the case of civilian
employees. In any case, all hands should be paid promptly at the last of
the month, thus getting all of these wages out of the way and avoiding the
necessity of any reversing entries or other expedients to show the real
operations of the Exchange. If any wages due the employees are not paid
by the end of the month, these amounts become “accrued wages” and must
be carried as such.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="FIGURING_SELLING_PRICES">FIGURING SELLING PRICES.</h2>

<p>This is done by some employee designated by the Exchange Officer;
sometimes it is done by the Exchange Officer himself. It is sometimes
prescribed by the Council that when organizations (shareholders in the
Exchange) order articles not in stock, the selling price shall be actual cost
to the Exchange of such articles. This cost would, of course, include any
transportation charges, etc., that were incurred, but the Exchange would
get the benefit of all cash discounts. It is also prescribed in some instances
that persons not stockholders in the Exchange who order merchandise
that is not in stock shall be charged a commission of 5%. Both
of these rules are sound, because, in the first case, any profits made by the
Exchange would simply revert in dividends to the organizations from
which the profits were made, assuming that all organizations transacted
the same amount of this kind of business. If they did not, it would still
be unjust to penalize one company for patronizing the Exchange by taking
from it money for distribution in dividends to other companies, regardless
of the amount of patronage the latter gave the Exchange. The second
rule is sound because the transaction is a quick sale, and the money of the
Exchange is tied up in stock for the minimum length of time. The selling
price in the above cases is, therefore, very easily determined.</p>

<p>In figuring out the selling price for the ordinary run of goods, the
process, while different, is never very difficult. We must base our calculations
on the smallest value used in coupon sales, except in the case of
staples sold only to charge customers. Ordinarily, the smallest purchase
that can be made with coupon books is five cents. We should, therefore,
in every possible case, make our selling price a number divisible by 5.
Cheap articles may be sold “2 for 5”, etc. It is a bad policy to sell articles
for 4 or 9 cents and have the clerk hand back change when a coupon sale
is made.</p>

<p>Articles that can be quickly and easily sold can be handled at a small
margin of profit, but articles that may prove to be “stickers” or those representing
a considerable investment should be made to pay a larger profit.</p>

<p>In this connection, the general policy of the Exchange may be made to
take one of two trends. The first policy is to sell all articles at the
minimum price consistent with making the Exchange self-supporting. In
this case, the amounts paid to the organizations in dividends will be proportionately
small, and consequently, the various companies will receive
little money to spend on their messes, athletics, etc. This plan would be
of considerable benefit to such customers of the Exchange as are not
stockholders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The other policy is to charge about the same prices as obtain in the
stores of nearby towns. In some cases of isolated posts, the prices could
be put even higher. This plan would result in larger dividends paid to
the companies but might entail the loss of customers, especially in these
days of mail-order and catalogue houses. This latter policy is upheld by
many able authorities, especially since the passage of the “anti-canteen”
law. According to one of the most able officers the writer has ever known,
this policy was stated about as follows:—“We should charge as high a
price as the traffic will stand. I do not want my men to spend their
money in town, for obvious reasons. I want them to spend it where they
themselves will get the benefit of the profits made on their purchases.
Therefore, give them good value for their money—as good as they can get
anywhere—but do <em>not</em> try for low prices and <em>do</em> make the Exchange so
attractive that they will naturally gather there and patronize it.”</p>

<p>In view of the above facts, and knowing the general policy of the
Exchange it is not difficult in the ordinary case, to fix a selling price for
our goods. We simply add the cost of transportation to the cost price
of the goods, add the desired profit and this gives us our approximate
selling price. In some Exchanges, other items of overhead charges, such
as clerk hire, depreciation, etc., are taken into consideration in fixing the
selling price. There should be ample space in the right hand columns of
Form 28, the receiving record, in which to figure the selling prices.</p>

<p>One of the results to be tried for in every Exchange is QUICK
SALES. It is a serious mistake to keep money tied up in stock any longer
than is absolutely necessary. A vivid illustration of this point is obtained
by taking the case of, say, an Italian banana vendor on the street. Let us
assume that he buys a bunch of bananas in the morning for $1.00. We
may rest assured that he will have sold out by evening; it is a certainty;
he is too good a merchant to do otherwise. Even supposing that he had
a bad day, and was compelled to close out part of his stock in the evening
at cut prices, he will have realized anywhere from $1.50 to $2.00 on his
sales, thus giving him from 25% to 50% gross profit. At this rate, he will
turn over his capital at least 25 times during one month, thus transacting
a total amount of business 25 times greater than his actual net resources,
and securing a profit equivalent to that of the greater amount. This is the
ideal toward which the Exchange should strive.</p>

<p>In this connection, do not state your profits as a percentage of the
COST price of your goods, but of the SELLING price. In other words,
if an article costs the Exchange $10.00, do not add one dollar to this for
the selling price and then imagine your profits will be 10% of your sales.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
If you desire 10% profit, then the cost must constitute 90% and you must
sell the article for $11.11 in order to make 10% on the sale. Take a
pencil and figure it yourself. A very good talk on this subject (and many
others of interest) is given in “A Better Day’s Profits”, published by the
Burroughs Adding Machine Company.</p>

<p>Another most excellent book containing many hints which would prove
of value to any Exchange Officer is one entitled, “Where Have My Profits
Gone?”, published by the American Sales Book Company of Elmira, New
York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LAUNDRIES">LAUNDRIES.</h2>

<p>Many Exchanges run laundries and while no attempt will be made
here to show how a laundry should be handled, it is thought proper to
explain how the books should be kept. The handling of actual laundry
work can be learned only by experience and it is an exceedingly difficult
task to prevent a flood of complaints unless careful supervision and checking
is in force.</p>

<p>As far as the Post Exchange Books are concerned, the Laundry need
furnish but three items:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) The amount owed by each customer for laundry work done
during the month.</p>

<p>(2) The total value of expendable articles on hand at the end of each
month. (Inventory.)</p>

<p>(3) The data for paying the wages of employees.</p>

</div>

<p>Any other records that may be kept are for the information of the Laundry
management, and are not essential to the proper running of the Exchange.
The above three headings will be discussed in turn.</p>

<h3>Bills Receivable for Laundry Work.</h3>

<p>The methods used in the case of enlisted men differ from those used
in the case of Officers and others of like classification; the former is rate
work and the latter is piece work. The former will be explained first.</p>

<p>The system about to be explained hinges about the Laundry List,
Form 20, shown in Fig. 34. These are 5 × 8 inches in size, made up in
pads of 100, fifty originals printed in black ink on white paper and fifty
duplicates printed in red on white paper. Thus, each book or pad will last one
man about one year. Each original and duplicate are on the same piece
of paper, folded at the bottom and the lower (duplicate) forms are
bound by their top edges, a piece of carbon paper being bound into each
pad so as to fall between the two copies. A glance at a “Paragon” style
of duplicating sales book will show clearly how this simple arrangement
works. The backs of all sheets should be fairly well covered with advertising
or other matter in order to prevent persons from ekeing out
their supply of stationery by using these forms. If desired, the instruction
shown on the face of the blank in the illustration could be placed on
the back instead. In quantities of 1,000 or so, these books should cost in
the neighborhood of 7 cents apiece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/figure34.jpg" width="450" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 34, (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p>With this arrangement, each man makes out two copies of his laundry
list with as little trouble as he formerly made out his single copy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
amount of clerical labor which this simple expedient obviates is simply
enormous. It makes the system practically automatic and saves labor
costs in the Laundry. The man puts both copies of his list in his bag of
laundry, and the laundry wagon calls at the company at the proper time
and collects same. The bag of wash is given to the “Marker”, who checks
off on the duplicate slip, all wash found in the bag. If everything is right,
the marker places the duplicate slip in a sorting tray, and lays the original
aside to be filed. If the list contains a mistake, the whole bundle is immediately
placed aside and is not touched until the owner has been sent for,
his mistake explained to him, and he has personally corrected both copies
of the list. This not only prevents controversies, but, also, makes the men
careful in making out their lists in order to avoid the necessity of visiting
the laundry to correct their lists.</p>

<p>In case any article is damaged when received at the laundry, it is
examined to see if it is properly marked, and then placed aside for the
inspection of the Officer in charge. This point will be touched upon later.</p>

<p>The duplicate lists remain in the sorting tray behind numbered guides
until the time comes to sort out the finished wash of the organization to
which the slips belong. When “marking in”, the marker either uses the
space “MARKING O. K.” provided for the purpose, or, as is usually the
case, we depend upon the personal check mark she places opposite each
item on the list. This marking is done on the duplicate list only.</p>

<p>When the finished wash is sorted, preparatory to delivery, the sorter
makes another check mark (different from the first one) opposite each
item that is put in the batch. No batch is allowed to go out with a shortage
if it can possibly be avoided; if any article is held for re-washing, it
is rushed through “special” and the whole bundle belonging to that particular
man is held back to wait for it. This prevents the laundry from
acquiring garments belonging to customers. If this is not done, a receipt
for the shortage should be delivered to the customer with his wash, and
a duplicate kept as a sort of tickler, to insure the missing articles being
put in the next batch of washing received from and done up for that
customer.</p>

<p>The original slips are inserted in alphabetical order in loose-leaf
binders, one binder for each organization. These binders should have a
2 inch back in order to hold one month’s slips conveniently. They form
our retained record and are invaluable in case of disputes. The duplicates
are given to the men when they come for their wash. While it is a great
convenience to the men to be permitted to get the wash of their friends,
at times, it has been found that this privilege is abused. In such a case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
each man may be compelled to come for his own wash, which will be found
to have a salutary effect. Ordinarily, it is sufficient to tear off the top of
the duplicate slips at the time of delivery, thus showing that the wash has
been called for and delivered.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each month, each organization makes out a list
of the men in the company, a carbon copy of Form 25 is the easiest to
furnish. On the first day upon which any organization sends wash to
the laundry, some designated N.C.O. of that organization marks in the
first blank column opposite each man’s name, information as to whether
or not he sent laundry on that date. Such entries would be “YES” (by
using a rubber stamp) if the man sent laundry; “S”, if he did not, through
being sick in hospital; “A”, meaning temporarily absent; “D”, meaning
discharged, etc. When the batches of wash belonging to this organization
are received at the laundry and each bundle or batch has been checked as
before described, the entries on the consolidated list are checked against
the original laundry slips as the latter are being placed in the binders.
This is to insure the correctness of the consolidated list. After this is
done, the consolidated list is returned to the organization, and the above
operations are repeated upon every succeeding wash-day during the month.</p>

<p>At the end of the month, all extras, such as charges for pressing uniforms,
excessive number of pieces in wash, etc., are charged up on the
original lists, the totals for the month found by mental addition and said
total entered on the last original list for the month pertaining to each
man, also, if desired, but only for cogent reasons, on the consolidated list.
These totals are then sent to the Post Exchange for incorporation in the
pay table collection sheet. If the binders are taken to the Exchange, the
totals can be read from them without the necessity of entering these totals
on the consolidated list at all. At this time, all of the original lists are
lifted from their binders, temporarily bound with twine, and sent to the
Exchange for file until the bills are paid, when they may be destroyed.</p>

<h3>Piece Work.</h3>

<p>In this case, a different list is used. See Form 21, shown in Fig. 35.
These lists are made up into duplicating pads just the same as the soldiers’
laundry lists, and are handled in exactly the same manner, except that no
consolidated list is kept. They measure 5 × 8 inches, like the others. At
the end of the month, the amount of laundry bills on each retained original
list is carried forward and the total entered on the last slip. These
totals are then transferred to the Charge Accounts Book previously described.
(Tearing a half inch off the upper right hand corner of all but
the last slip for the month for each customer makes the binder self-indexing.)</p>

<p>The above shows how all amounts due the laundry are transferred to
the Exchange books, but there are one or two points in this connection
that deserve at least a passing notice. The first of these is the</p>

<h3>Damage Report.</h3>

<p>This, Form 24, shown in Fig. 36, should be made up in the form of a
duplicating pad, 3 × 5 inches being a standard size. One copy of this
form, preferably, the original, is retained in the book or filed in a card
index drawer; the duplicate is returned to the proper customer with his
wash in which the damaged articles were found. As before noted, when
damaged clothing is found in any wash during the “marking in” process,
the damaged articles are placed aside. They are then entered on this form,
inspected by the officer in charge, or person designated by him, and then
sent through the wash.</p>

<img src="images/figure36.jpg" width="500" height="425" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 36, (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<h3>Claim Settlements.</h3>

<p>When a claim for damages, loss, etc., is settled in favor of the claimant
a report should be made on Form 22 (See Fig. 37), to the Post Exchange.
This form should be made up in triplicating pads, one copy for the Exchange
book-keeper; another, plainly stamped “duplicate”, for the claimant,
and a third to be retained by the Laundry, either in the book or in a card
index drawer, preferably the latter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/figure37.jpg" width="500" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 37, (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<h3>Inventories.</h3>

<p>These are taken in the same general way as in other branches of the
Exchange except that the cost price alone is considered. When finished,
the totals shown by the various cards are added on the machine and the
result given to the Exchange book-keeper in order to permit him to make
out the profit and loss sheet. The cards are filed in a card index drawer
until they are used up, when they may be transferred to a dead file.</p>

<h3>Pay Rolls.</h3>

<p>These are handled in exactly the same manner as the Exchange pay
roll. They may be made out separately by the Laundry authorities or incorporated
in the regular Exchange roll. In any case, they should be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
out from the time book kept by the Laundry superintendent. The accuracy
of this book should be checked frequently in the usual ways.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Laundry Records.</h3>

<p>In addition to the above, the laundry should keep accurate track of the
amounts spent in repairs or renewals of each machine or component part
of the laundry. In the inventory book should be entered a proper rate of
depreciation against each machine, etc., and this depreciation should be
written off periodically by the Exchange Council, say once per year. Then,
if any organization wishes to sell out or to buy in, it will be a simple matter
to arrive at a proper valuation of the laundry and its fixtures.</p>

<p>There should be on hand blueprints of the laundry building, showing
dimensions and details of construction. There should also be on hand a
complete diagram of all the steam and water pipes, connections, valves, etc.</p>

<p>For cost-keeping, which would be desirable if it can be done conveniently
without adding too much cost, other records would have to be
kept. The Baker-Vawter Company has given this point special attention
and have devised a system which is used by many members of the Laundryman’s
National Association.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="AUDITING">AUDITING.</h2>

<p>It is not too much to say that the monthly audit of the Exchange
books is usually done poorly and inefficiently. This is due to several
causes. In the first place, very few officers have ever had experience
fitting them for such a task, and still fewer have any liking for the operation.
The average audit consists of counting the cash and seeing if the
vouchers to the cash account are correct, but a proper audit is something
different. The Council should expect, as a result of the audit, a clear
statement of the status of the Exchange together with recommendations
for improvement and reports of any irregularities, etc. An auditing officer
who spends his time finding out whether or not the books contain any
mistakes in addition is not performing his proper functions as auditor.</p>

<p>Reduced to its simplest terms the duties of an auditor may be expressed
as finding the correct answers to the following:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Were all assets on hand as shown?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Were there any assets not shown?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Were all the liabilities real ones?</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Were all liabilities shown?</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Were all liabilities properly incurred?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Were all earnings accounted for?</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Were any earnings omitted from the statement?</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) Were all disbursements, expenses and losses properly stated and
supported?</p>

<p>In the following pages an attempt will be made to lay down a system
of procedure which will enable the auditor to secure proper answers to the
above questions in the most expeditious manner. For this purpose, the
use of Form 33, shown below, is recommended. They should be on
sheets conforming in size and punching to those used in the book used for
recording the proceedings of the Exchange Council. This remark also
applies to Forms 16 and 32, previously described.</p>

<h2 id="CASH_REGISTERS">CASH REGISTERS.</h2>

<p>In Post Exchange business, these machines are ordinarily used in recording
all sales, although some Exchanges do not ring up their charge
sales, but rely upon the sales slip alone, an unsafe practice. There is,
besides, a saving in ringing up all sales. These machines, if properly handled,
and used in conjunction with our stock records at selling price should
amply protect the Exchange.</p>

<p>In order to secure the maximum benefit from a cash register, however,
it should be suited to the work in hand. Many registers handle but two
kinds of sales, charge and cash; but we have a third kind, coupon sales,
and the registers in use by every department which handles all three kinds
should be arranged for such work. This kind of a register has three
separate adding mechanisms, the appropriate set being thrown into mesh
by means of a movable clutch and indicator at the left of the keyboard.
In ringing up each sale, the clerk sets the indicator at “cash”, “coupons”
or “charge”, as the case may be, before turning the handle; the total sales
of any kind can be read at any time by anyone possessing the key which
unlocks the reading window. Thus, the Steward, at the close of business
on any day, can ascertain these totals in a few seconds, instead of having
to transfer them from the cash register record tape to the adding machine.
Thus, considerable time and labor are saved.</p>

<p>We should also be able to tell which clerk made every sale. This is
accomplished by having a separate push button for every clerk and requiring
the clerks to punch the proper button before ringing up their sale.
The record tape of the machine will then show the full particulars of
every sale—how much it was, what kind of a sale it was and who made it.</p>

<p>The size of the keyboard is determined by the probable value of the
largest sale. In departments where there can be but two different kinds
of sales, say charge and cash, a machine without the movable clutch can
be used.</p>

<p>A modern development of the cash register is the “Slip Printing” device.
By this, we mean the printing of the amount of sale on the sales slip
itself, instead of on the “chop ticket”. In our system of recording charge
sales, where the customer is given a copy of the sales slip, it is unnecessary
for him to have the chop ticket, too, but it is necessary for us to know
that his sales slip calls for the same amount that has been rung up on the
register. For this purpose, the register can and should be arranged for
“Slip Printing”, that is, for printing directly on the sales slip whatever
amount is rung up on the register. This arrangement can be made without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
extra cost in the case of a new machine. The sales slip then handed to
the customer then shows him exactly what amount was rung up on the
register. The slip shown in Fig. 1 was treated in this way, although the
slip was not originally designed for this work. Another slip is shown in
Fig. 38. A cash register embodying the above described characteristics is
shown in Fig. 39.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/figure38.jpg" width="425" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 38, (Reduced in size)</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/figure39.jpg" width="500" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 39</p>
</div>

<p>It is apparent that if we can be sure that all sales are rung up on the
register the Exchange can suffer no loss except by persons taking stock
from the shelves, a proposition which is cared for by our stock records.
Therefore, it is important to devise means for insuring that every sale is
properly rung up. There are various means to this end. One is to provide
a series of locked boxes, one for each organization at the post, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
provided with a slit in the cover large enough to admit a chop ticket.
These boxes to be plainly labelled with the designation of the respective
organizations, and all customers to be instructed to drop their chop tickets
into these boxes. Whenever dividends are declared, a certain proportion
of same to be divided in the same proportion as exists among the total
values of the tickets in the various boxes. Unless these tickets are counted
by a committee from the various organizations, this scheme would entail
considerable clerical work for the Exchange office force. The scheme
practically amounts to distributing a part of the dividend according to the
amount of business done by the respective organizations—a necessity in
the rare case when one or more organizations boycott the Exchange. It is
said that the members of the various organizations soon become efficient
agents in promoting the practice of customers demanding the chop tickets
from the clerks.</p>

<p>Another scheme is for the Exchange Officer to inspect the serial numbers
of the sales recorded for a certain time, say one month, and to
arbitrarily select some one of these numbers, publish a notice concerning
same, and to present to the person who produces the chop ticket bearing
that number, a credit at the Exchange of $5.00 or so. The Exchange could
easily afford to do this, as the advantages accruing from having every sale
rung up will more than counterbalance this small expenditure. Other devices
will readily suggest themselves to those who are interested in the
subject.</p>

<p>The Steward should, of course, keep accurate track of the readings of
the various dials of the registers. Cash register companies issue books
for this purpose. The keys to the registers should be jealously guarded,
including those to the reading windows. A record should be kept of the
readings of those dials which show how many times the lid of the register
has been opened.</p>

<p>In leaving this subject, a further discussion of which is necessarily
curtailed, it will be well to add that the best way to get satisfaction in this
line is to write to the firm whose register you intend buying and ask them
to send you their local representative and such descriptive literature as
they may have at hand. It will then be an easy matter to secure a machine
exactly suited to the needs of the case.</p>

<h2 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>In the foregoing pages, the writer has attempted to outline a system of
record-keeping for our Post Exchanges that is at once simple and efficient,
complying with the desiderata set forth in the opening pages. No contention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
is made that the system is perfect and incapable of improvement; but
it is the best that the writer has seen in twelve years’ experience with Post
Exchanges. It is hoped that it will at least prove worthy of being taken
under advisement by most Post Exchanges and many of its points put into
practice. Strenuous efforts have been made to explain the system in such
simple language that the average employee of an Exchange could install
and operate it, without the necessity of the Exchange Officer devoting his
personal efforts to it. An effort has also been made to simplify matters
for the Exchange Council and for officers detailed to audit the accounts, to
show what points are important and what are not, how to secure a clear
idea of what the business is actually doing in all its branches, and how to
prevent leaks.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
